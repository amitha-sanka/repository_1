<ul>
  <li>Only girl to enter the field in engineering, no one in her family pursued science especially girls</li>
  <li>Faced gender roles in terms of being told be her family and friends that she should stick to be a girl that does household chores and was told that she should leave the breadwinner role to her husband</li>
  <li>After hearing everyone say this she wntd to prove them wrong and prove to herself that she was capable and began to discover her capabilities this way</li>
  <li>excited to come to San Diego because the Qualcomm headquarters were there</li>
  <li>although she was scared to make a huge move from India to San Diego, she was still so ecstatic because it was a new opportunity</li>
  <li>joined Qualcomm’s 4G project</li>
  <li>paused double e because she knew she could build up n the skills and electrical engineering double e would not close her doors</li>
  <li>having a growth mindset is key to becoming a successful software engineering</li>
  <li>hardware: design electronics, design and develop chips using languages like VLHS</li>
  <li>software: use and run it,</li>
  <li>learn coding in all engineerings except civil engineering</li>
  <li>hardware takes instruction from software</li>
  <li>software and hardware have to work closely together for final product</li>
  <li>companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Qualcomm are all companies that are looking for recruits</li>
  <li>Qualcomm = chips</li>
  <li>Apple = iPhone, computers</li>
  <li>Google = Virtual Reality, headset, Fitbit</li>
  <li>Amazon = Fire stick</li>
  <li>going above and beyond and challenging yourself is what colleges and universities are looking for</li>
  <li>take classes during high school where you are concurrently enroll in community college classes to show rigor</li>
  <li>learned the way to balance life and her work</li>
  <li>major challenge they faced was balancing life being a mother and working</li>
  <li>check your schools clubs to check out and its a good start to join your schools robotics team</li>
  <li>join a FIRST robotics team</li>
  <li>PlayStation used to hire students and they would get - paid to play video games before they released</li>
  <li>check potential job listings to be more involved in engineering</li>
  <li>As a student to be more involved a way to go is to be join the robotics team at school and interacting and making connections with teachers and students that may help you get options</li>
</ul>
