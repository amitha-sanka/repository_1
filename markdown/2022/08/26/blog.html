<p>I went to La Jolla beach with my friends and we walked around and found the La Jolla Observatory Deck, which is a hidden spot in San Diego. We watched the sunset from the deck and it was pretty. After, we went to Del Mar and got dinner in a food court. I had ramen with chicken and it tasted really good. The name of the restaurant is Marufuku ramen in Del Mar. After we ate dinner we went to One Paseo and got ice cream at Salt &amp; Straw.</p>

<p>I ran errands with my dad and drove him to each place he needed to go to because I have my permit, so I get in my driving practice while my dad gets his errands done. In the afternoon, I went to my best friend’s birthday party. She turned 17. Before the party, I went to my friend’s house and I got ready with her. Then, we both went to our friend’s house and met up with everyone. She got a party bus for everyone, so we took the party bus to Little Italy in San Diego Downtown. On the way there, we all sang and danced to music. After one hour we got down in Little Italy and ate dinner at an Italian restaurant. I had lobster ravioli followed by tiramisu cake, which were both very good. After we finished with dinner, we went on the party bus on the way home and danced and sang. I had a lot of fun and it was enjoyable.</p>

<p>I spent the day with my family. It started off with going to the farmer’s market with my parents. I had a chocolate almond croissant there and it has been my favorite croissant I have ever had in my life. Afterwards, I came back home and started doing my homework, which took almost until 9 PM.</p>
