<p>The College Board performance task criteria has requirements of an apporiate project that is demonstrated through a write up and video. Through showing the grader that we know our information and have a thorough understanding of it according to the student learning objectives.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My role: Frontend</li>
  <li>My feature: Your Likes Page
    <ul>
      <li>Goal: To keep track of what landmarks and activities users like and keeps and organizes user’s progress in one place</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-part">
<a class="anchor" href="#my-part" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My part</h2>

<p>For my group’s Collegeboard Performance Task, we are going to create a travel website where users can plan their trip in the San Diego County area and choose landmarks to visit. This will help with time and budget management. Our primary audience for our website are tourists and San Diego county residents that are finding something to do or see. I am going to be working on the Your Likes page, which is where users can keep track of what landmarks and activities they like by simply clicking a heart shaped button.</p>

<h2 id="code-plan">
<a class="anchor" href="#code-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Plan</h2>

<p>The coding plan for the Your Likes page aims for any time a user hearts soemthing, the item will be stored in a table database. We plan to use Python to save the user’s progress as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition, we will be implementing CRUD into the Your Likes page: Create: User inputs their details for the trip in a filter and data will be saved, Read: usrs can access their like page which is saved each time, Update and Delete; users can remove liked landmarks/activities in narrowing down places or they could add more.</p>

<h2 id="video-plan">
<a class="anchor" href="#video-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Video Plan</h2>

<p>In my writeup and video, I plan to use the Collegeboard criteria to clearly and expliclity get acorss my idea to the grader and others. I will test the feature, Your Likes page and do a run through demonstration while simotaneuosly describing and explaining the iterations, procedures, and algorithms I used. In the video, I will show a user accessing the activites page and hearting the items and then show how the hearted items appear on the Your Likes page.</p>
