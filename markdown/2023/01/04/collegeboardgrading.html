<p>After looking at student 1 and 2’s projects and Collegeboard’s grading, I learned…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speak clearly</li>
  <li>Keep the video concise</li>
  <li>Use user input</li>
  <li>In the written response, be clear when discussing code segments</li>
  <li>To make the video effective, be quick</li>
</ul>
