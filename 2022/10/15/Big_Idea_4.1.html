<ul>
  <li>1975 still had big computers</li>
  <li>arpanet is the first net we had</li>
  <li>Advanced Research Projects Agency NETWORK</li>
  <li>the computers got smaller and smaller</li>
  <li>packet: small amount of data sent over a network, consists of source and destination information</li>
  <li>electrons use number systems</li>
  <li>computer network: group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data</li>
  <li>computer network is a type computing system</li>
  <li>computer system: group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint response</li>
  <li>packet switching: file/message is that is broken up into packets and sent in any order, packets are portrayed as the recipitent’s device</li>
  <li>routing: helps find the path from sender to receiver</li>
  <li>path: between 2 computing devices, sender and receiver, a sequence of connected computing device that starts at the sender and ends at the receiver</li>
  <li>bandwidth is measured using bits per second</li>
  <li>bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network</li>
  <li>use packets to transmit data</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>protocol: agreed upon set of rules that specifies the system behavior</li>
  <li>OSI (open systems interconnect): layers to go through to communicate</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>TCP (transmission control protocol): creates a common standard to send messages between different devices on the internet</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>IETF (interest engineering task force): manages development of standards and technical discussions about the open internet</li>
  <li>network access layer: setting up hardware that carries 0’s and 1’s between 2 devices, common example ethernet cable, used for local hops</li>
  <li>network access/internet layer data transmission: consists of data being transmitted and metadata that had information used for routing information</li>
  <li>routers are unique computers with a MAC address</li>
  <li>internet is scaleable and can meet the demands out there</li>
  <li>Autonomous systems (AS): large intranets liked together under control and rules of major companies, large routers connect with large telecommunications connections</li>
  <li>Local area network (LAN): physical connections (ethernet cable), limited by hardware and physics, 1 to 100s of systems</li>
  <li>Intranet: LANs connected by Routers within an organization</li>
  <li>Internet: autonomous systems (AS) linked together</li>
  <li>Transport Layer:</li>
  <li>TCP is stricter because it ensures that the package was delivered, error checking and error recovery - slower</li>
  <li>UDP: laidback and slower, performs error checking, discards errors packets</li>
  <li>Internet Layer</li>
  <li>port: number given to application/service</li>
</ul>

<p>Application Layer</p>
<ul>
  <li>http: how to ask/receive data from web servers - uses TCP, Port 80 at transport layer</li>
  <li>https: has security, users TCP Port 443</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="test-correction">Test Correction:</h2>

<p>Quiz 1:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Protocols allow multiple telecommunication companies to communicate in an easy way and the protocols make it more convenient.</li>
  <li>I misread the answer choices and did not notice how the answer I chose said “protocol” instead of “site.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Quiz 2:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I did not pay close attention to the image in the question, which is why I got the question wrong and if I looked at lines 3 and 7 I believe I would’ve got the question right. Interchanging lines 3 and 7 ensures that if reducing score by penalty results in a negative value, score is set to 0.</li>
