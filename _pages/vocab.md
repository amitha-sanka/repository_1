# Unit 2 Binary & Data 
---------------
- <mark>Bits:<mark> a 0/1 value
- <mark>Bytes:<mark> 8 bits
- <mark>Hexadecimal:<mark> name of the numbering system that is base 16
- <mark>Nibbles:<mark> four-bit binary number

## Binary Numbers:
- <mark>Unsigned Integer:<mark> 32-bit non-negative integer(0 or positive numbers) in the range of 0 to 2^32-1
- <mark>Signed Integer:<mark> 32-bit integer in the range of -(2^31) = -2147483648 to (2^31) â€“ 1=2147483647 which contains positive or negative numbers
- <mark>Floating Point:<mark>  data format to represent real numbers with both an integer and fractional component

## Binary Data Abstractions
- <mark>Boolean<mark> expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements
- <mark>ASCII:<mark> returns a readable version of any object (Strings, Tuples, Lists)
- <mark>Unicode:<mark> specification that aims to list every character used by human languages and give each character its own unique code
- <mark>RGB:<mark> tuple of 3 components

## Data Compression
- <mark>Lossy: <mark> (not discussed yet)
- <mark>Lossless:<mark> (not discussed yet)

# Unit 3 Algorithm & Programming  
-------------------
- <mark>Variables:<mark> an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values
- <mark>Data Types:<mark> there are different data types; numeric, sequence, mapping, set 
- <mark>Assignment Operators:<mark> allows a program to change the value represented to a variable

## Managing Complexity with Variables 

- <mark>Lists:<mark> allow consistent computations and changing the number of variables and helps multiple items that are related to each other to be treated a single value
- <mark>2D Lists:<mark>  two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory 
- <mark>Dictionaries:<mark> used to store data values in key:value pairs 
- <mark>Class:<mark> an outline for creating a new object
- <mark>Algorithms:<mark> a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer
- <mark>Sequence:<mark> steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. 
- <mark>Selection:<mark> is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available
- <mark>Iteration:<mark> repeating steps, or instructions over and over again
- <mark>Expressions:<mark> combination of operators and operands
- <mark>Comparison Operators:<mark> Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right AND Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right

## Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables

- <mark>Characters:<mark> one single unit of a text or character string, or individual characters 
- <mark>Strings:<mark> sequence of characters, consists of letters, numbers, and special characters
- <mark>Length:<mark> ordered sequence of elements, elements are variables
- <mark>Concatenation:<mark> operation of joining two strings together
- <mark>Upper:<mark> converts all lowercase characters in a string into uppercase characters 
- <mark>Lower:<mark> converts all of the characters to lowercase

## Traversing Strings

- <mark>Python If:<mark> go through certain statements if the if expression is true
- <mark>Elif:<mark> go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false

## Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements

- <mark>Python For:<mark> repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated 
- <mark>While loops with Range, with List:<mark> used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met

## Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue

- <mark>Procedural Abstraction:<mark> provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it does not, how it does it
- <mark>Python Def procedures:<mark> a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.
- <mark>Parameters:<mark> input values of a procedure
- <mark>Return Values:<mark> values that a function returns when it completes
