HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . A decidable problem is a problem for which algorithms can be written to solve and produce a correct output for all inputs and an example of a decidable problem is if a store bought 100 apples, then their balance would be 100 apples. Whereas an undecidable problem is a problem for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution. An example of an undecidable problem is if you were given a computer program that calculates grades, the user will input their current grade. So, the program will loop forever until the user receives their output. . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 &lt;/p&gt; C. is correct because a 3 step algorithm consists of when there is a variable multiplied by an integer, all to the power of 2. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Input In [5] function peak_finder(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Answer: . function peak_finder2(array){ if (array.length)=== 0{ return `Array cannot be empty` }else if (array.length === 1){ return array[0] }else{ let mid_index = Math.floor(array.length*0.5) if (array[mid_index +1]&gt;array[mid_index]){ return peak_finding(array.slice(mid_index + 1 )) }else if (array[mid_index -1]&gt;array[mid_index]){ new=array.reverse().slice(mid_index+1).reverse() return peak_finding(new) }else{ return array[mid_index] } } } . Input In [6] function peak_finder2(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . I attempted doing this hack, however, I got stuck and did not understand so, I looked the answer to gain a better understanding. After, looking at the answer I noticed how the code in the answer is condensed in a simpler and shortened format and way, however still has the same function. In addition, the answer code does not set the peak, counter, and peak_index to 0 since using the counter function already assumes that it begins at the value 0 and that there is no reason in for typing in the 0. There are also array.slice and mid_index, which I observed were being used in substitution for the if else statement. The if else command is also used to reverse the array and to find the peak. Ultimately, the code is written in a shortened and simpler format in order to be efficient and easily understand for the user. . HACK 4: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . Answer: . givendata = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] print(&quot;data unsorted:&quot;, givendata) print (&quot;.....&quot;) givendata.sort() print(&quot;data sorted&quot;, givendata) . data unsorted: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] ..... data sorted [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Here, I used the Python function &quot;sort&quot; to order the list of number from lowest to greatest. . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Answer: . from itertools import permutations # import permutations with library function data = [1,2,3] # all the possible permutations for a in permutations(data): print(a) # print permutations . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . In this code, I imported the permutation function from the library itertools, so I can make the permutation command. Then, I used a loop so I can iterate all the potential permutations to print permutations. . Reflection . In this section, I learned about all the different types of algorithms. I learned the difference between each one and how to use new Python functions. I learned how different algorithms differ from each other and also when to use certain algorithms and when not to use them. Since particular algorithms are used based on situation by situation. The lesson was also presented well, all the examples were extremely helpful and helped me understand the material and complete the hacks thoroughly. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

From today&#39;s lesson on Sections 14 and 15, I learned about libraries and the different functions I can use to create randomization. I learned that libraries are useful in terms of simplfying a program and being more efficient when doing so. Using documentation is helpful when writing code because you can easily refer to it and understand it easily for yourself or even when helping others. There are multiple random. functions which help generate values in different. The random. functions are random.item, shuffle, and randint, which all have a different function and are used in different cases. In terms of how the lesson, I think I grasped the topics easily and understood the content thoroughly due to how the lesson was organized and taught. It was taught in a organized way and .

D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random Explanation: This is not part of the random library because you cannot random a random.&lt;/p&gt; C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? | The advantage of using libraries is that libraries help simplify complex programs and they also collect prewritten code and procedures. Libraries also help maximize their efficiency too. .

EXTRA-CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: . Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points. This will not likely be the only way to get a perfect score, however. . &lt;/div&gt; . | | | .",

Determine the number of iterations required to find a value in a data set. | Explain the requirements necessary to complete a binary search. | The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. | Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm | A binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data. | While using Binary Search you have to put the group of numbers from ascending or descending order | What the computer does it takes the lowest index and the highest index, adds them and then divides that value by 2. | This gets the middle value and starts the search at the middle of the group. | .

Question 4 . . Question 5 . Explain thorughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) . In order to find the number 69 in the list above, I would use the middle index, which is 4.5 and round it to 5. The fifth number in the sequence is 6, and 6 is less than 69. After finding the middle index, you have to find the first half middle index and second half middle index. The work for how I found the numbers of each index is shown in question 6. I used all the elements in the list given to find the number 69. . Question 6 . . Question 7 . Unsorted List of Strings . [“store”, ”Market”, ”Walmart”, &quot;Target”, ”Ralphs”] . Sorted List of Strings . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . Question 8 . Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search. . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because it makes it easier to find an item in a sorted list of items. It&#39;s more efficient because it works by continuously dividing half the proportion of the list , which could contain the item until it is narrowed down to one location. It is useful and efficient especially when there is a large set of data because it sorts it and finds the user’s final goal. Sequential search Is not as efficient as binary search because it finds a value in an unsorted array. However, if an array is sorted in the order of increasing value, then binary search is the most efficient and ideal way to go when approaching searching. . Question 9 . [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . . I&#39;m finding number 16 and it would take one check to find the number 16. It would take one check because the order of the numbers are ascending up, so it would give me the middle index number. .",

What is Iteration? . Iterative statements are also called loops, and they repeat themselves over and over until the condition for stopping is met. . In College Board&#39;s Pseudocode, the first is a REPEAT n TIMES loop, where the n represents some number. . The second type of loop is a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop, where the loop will continue to run until a condition is met. . Conceptually, a while loop is very similar to an if conditional, except that a while is continually executed until it&#39;s no longer true and an if is only executed once. . Practice . Consider the Following Code Segment. What is the Counter Variable and the Condition set as? . for (var i = 10; i &gt; 0; i--) { println(i); } . Answer!

How Many times will print(ln) be called? . for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) { for (var j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j++) { println(i * j); } } . Answer! [100 Times.The computer will execute the outer for loop 10 times (starting at i = 1 and ending after i = 10). Each time that it executes the outer loop, it will execute the inner for loop 10 times (starting at j = 1 and ending after j = 10). Each inner execution will call println() once.10 times 10 times 1 is 100, so the computer will call println() 100 times.] Practice . Consider the Following Code Segment. What is it initial value?

Explanation: My answer choice is wrong because I got confused with the defintion of what a POP command does. A POP command removes the last item in a list. My confusion is now cleared up after this question, and this will help me better understand what a POP command does and its function. . Question 8 . Explanation: My answer choice is wrong because the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop does not iterate over an iterable and for a set amount of time and does not intuitively take an iterable or manipulate it over a set period using pointers. . Reflection . Initially, this lesson was difficult to understand because it was a very fast-paced lesson, which made it hard to follow along. Overall, it was a lesson that was difficult to understand while the information was being presented, however, after applying thr information I learned to the exercises and quizes, it put together all the information and it helped make sense in my mind. The exercises was helpful since it was practical and I had to type the code and watch it for mistakes. .",

A student with 3 issues and 1 complete scrumboard task would receive a score of 2.0 because they do not have atleast more than 5 scrumboard tasks. . Reflection: . After this lesson, I learned how to create and write a flowchart in pseudocode while given a scenario. I also learned how to use a dictionary and use nested conditionals. I learned how to use if and if-else statements, and the difference between the two. An if statement is when you go through certain statements if the if expression is true. Whereas, if-else statement are when you go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false. I learned how to read and interpret different types of operators, AND, OR, and not through the binary truth practice. The binary truth practice was difficult initially, however, I understood it after my group explained it to me. I followed a tutorial to use nested conditionals in my Python dictionary, which was helpful since I was new to using and coding nested conditionals. .",

Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program test - input burger, expect output of burger price run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;Your total price is: $&quot; + str(menu[item])) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 Your total price is: $3.99 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... .

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",

I went to La Jolla beach with my friends and we walked around and found the La Jolla Observatory Deck, which is a hidden spot in San Diego. We watched the sunset from the deck and it was pretty. After, we went to Del Mar and got dinner in a food court. I had ramen with chicken and it tasted really good. The name of the restaurant is Marufuku ramen in Del Mar. After we ate dinner we went to One Paseo and got ice cream at Salt &amp; Straw. . Saturday: . I ran errands with my dad and drove him to each place he needed to go to because I have my permit, so I get in my driving practice while my dad gets his errands done. In the afternoon, I went to my best friend’s birthday party. She turned 17. Before the party, I went to my friend’s house and I got ready with her. Then, we both went to our friend’s house and met up with everyone. She got a party bus for everyone, so we took the party bus to Little Italy in San Diego Downtown. On the way there, we all sang and danced to music. After one hour we got down in Little Italy and ate dinner at an Italian restaurant. I had lobster ravioli followed by tiramisu cake, which were both very good. After we finished with dinner, we went on the party bus on the way home and danced and sang. I had a lot of fun and it was enjoyable. . Sunday: . I spent the day with my family. It started off with going to the farmer’s market with my parents. I had a chocolate almond croissant there and it has been my favorite croissant I have ever had in my life. Afterwards, I came back home and started doing my homework, which took almost until 9 PM. .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Lists: allow consistent computations and changing the number of variables and helps multiple items that are related to each other to be treated a single value | 2D Lists: two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory | Dictionaries: used to store data values in key:value pairs | Class: an outline for creating a new object | Algorithms: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer | Sequence: steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. | Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available | Iteration: repeating steps, or instructions over and over again | Expressions: combination of operators and operands | Comparison Operators: Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right AND Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right | . Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables . Characters: one single unit of a text or character string, or individual characters | Strings: sequence of characters, consists of letters, numbers, and special characters | Length: ordered sequence of elements, elements are variables | Concatenation: operation of joining two strings together | Upper: converts all lowercase characters in a string into uppercase characters | Lower: converts all of the characters to lowercase | . Traversing Strings . Python If: go through certain statements if the if expression is true | Elif: go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false | . Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements . Python For: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated | While loops with Range, with List: used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met | . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it | Python Def procedures: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Parameters: input values of a procedure | Return Values: values that a function returns when it completes | .",
