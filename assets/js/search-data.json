Overview: Pandas is a powerful tool in Python that is used for data analysis and manipulation. In this lesson, we will explore how to use Pandas to work with datasets, analyze them, and visualize the results. . Learning Objectives: . By the end of this lesson, students should be able to: . Understand what Pandas is and why it is useful for data analysis | Load data into Pandas and create tables to store it | Use different functions in Pandas to manipulate data, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping | Visualize data using graphs and charts | . Question Who here has used numpy???? . (should be all odf you because all of you have used it in this class before. ) . what is pandas? . no not this . this: . Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. | it can handle different types of data, including CSV files and databases. | it also allows you to create tables to store and work with your data. | it has functions for filtering, sorting, and grouping data to make it easier to work with. | it also has tools for visualizing data with graphs and charts. | it is widely used in the industry for data analysis and is a valuable skill to learn. | companies that use Pandas include JPMorgan Chase, Google, NASA, the New York Times, and many others. | .

Look into all of this on the Internet and note down important information you find (0.45) . In order to find the difference of two binary numbers, the borrowing method needs to be used. After researching, I found that this was the best and easy way that made sense to me. First, you subtract the right binary number and the right binary number from the minued. In some cases, depending on the number you need to borrow from the left and add two to the minued. The next step is to just subtract the remaining numbers and borrow depending on the circumstance. To find the product of binary numbers, its like decimal multiplcation. So, you multiply one number by the other and you add the product results. To find the quotient, you need to divide both the binary numbers, using long division and dividing decimals. Then, this all leads to your quotient of the binary numbers. . Subtracting Binary Numbers Rules . 1-1 1-0 0-1 0-0 . 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | . Multiplying Binary Numbers Rules . 1x1 1x0 0x1 0x0 . 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . Dividing Binary Numbers Rules . 1/1 0/1 . 1 | 0 | | . .

This is a third party API about country location and details that I used above. . Data Compression . Lossless images are in a JPG image format, consisting of lossy data. JPGs are always in a lossless format. They work by shorter code segments that are compressed and also go back into their original form. A few examples of lossless compression algorithms include deflate and Huffman coding. . Whereas lossy image, which means it is in a PNG format. PNG uses a compression algorithm which keeps the picture&#39;s original data without information/data being lost. Lossy algorithms work by removing the unneccesary data and unimportant data, this plays a key role in compression. This type of compression can be seen in audious and pictures and examples of lossy compression algorithms include MP3 and JPEG files. . This is an example of a lossy versus lossless data compression. . . The Game . Level 1: . The first level works that the way it is because the result of the first one is 1 due to XOR. Knowing this, that part must be equal to 0. I also used the truth table, which is how I got to the answer XOR. | . Level 2: . The second level works the way it does because the XNOR gate is a product of 1 being 0 and 0. The or gate has inputs of 1 and 0, with a product of 0. Adding the combination of XNOR and NAND gates produces the result. | .",

How does the number guesser game work? . The number guesser game works by function in the code chosing a random number. Then, the user has to guess a number from 1-100 and they press the submit button, which then tells the user if their number is too low or too high. The button has three different outputs of too low, correct, and too high and the user basically inputs a number until they get it correct based on what the website prints. | . Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing? . SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing because the background of the random number guesser game was changed. In order to change the text color and to customize and personalize the button, SASS was also used here. The background of the random number generator is initially red, however, when the user gets the number correct the background turns green. So, SASS was used in this part of the random number generator. In order to position the text and the font size on the website, SASS was used to center the text and the buttons. | .

The answer is B because Lego ensures that domains are always secured with up to date certificates. . Hacks . OpenSSL and LibreSSL have several types of security features. They both provide a range of security features for applications and systems. One security feature is certificates where OpenSSL and LibreSSL both use SSL/TLS certificates. LibreSSL reduces the risk of memory leaks and elimnates attack vectors. In terms of API compatibility, LibreSSL is designed to be API-compatible with OpenSSL. The difference here is that LibreSSL uses a different random number generaotr than OpenSSL. Since LibreSSL has made changes to the OpenSSL codebase they have improved security and removed potential vulnerabilities, so it is a tiny bit more secure than LibreSSL. Ultimately, the security between the both mainly depends on the situation, use, and security requirements. . There have been recent vulnerabilites within OpenSSL and LibreSSL. OpenSSL vulnerabilities include CVE-2021-3449 which overflows in the X.509 certificate parsing code of OpenSSL. Another vulnerability is CVE-2020-1967, which is a padding oracle that can decrypt between a client and server. CVE-2020-1971 vulnerability is the X.509 certificate validation code of OpenSSL. LibreSSL vulnerabilites include CVE-2020-1972, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the ASN.1 parsing code of LibreSSL. CVE-2020-13777, a timing side-channel vulnerability in the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher implementation of LibreSSL. Lastly, another vulnerability is CVE-2019-1543, a denial of service vulnerability in the SSL/TLS certificate handling code of LibreSSL. . KASM Virtual Desktop on EC2 Guide . Hacks . Virtual desktops and KASM play signifcant roles in enhancing the security of computer systems. They both help run multiple desktop environments simoltaneously on one machine.

By using the services such as EC2 it helps compute the database. The tools and services provided by AWS help users manage cloud resources and help users create, configure, and monitor autonmous tasks. . Question 2: How is AWS useful for projects? . AWS is useful for projects because AWS projects let you scale up or down based on demand and traffic in order to accomdate growth over time. AWS is also cost effective because users can pay as they go. Users can also deploy projects and applications fairly easily because AWS provides tools and services to deply in the cloud. There is also a lot of security surrounded around AWS because there are several security features that protect data and applications. . Question 3: How does Duck DNS Work? . Duck DNS works as a free service that allows users to assign a domain name to a IP address. Users first have to make a account and sign to chose a domain name. The domain name already has a given form and it installs a client on the device that has the IP address. Later, the configuration occurs and Duck DNS account information is used for your domain name and accout token. Duck DNS processes all updates by itself. Users can access their IP address easily and can access it from anywhere after. . Question 4: How is Duck DNS useful for projects? . Duck DNS is useful for projects because it has a easy setup process that helps set up and configure. Several other services and tools can be used along with DuckDNS, so it ends up being more useful for specific projects and situations. Users can assign a domain name to nay device with a IP address, so there is a lot of flexibility included too. Lastly, Duck DNS is a free service online, so it is a cost effective way of getting a domain for free without paying expensive prices. . Diagram . What are the pros and cons of using Duck DNS Show a diagram of an application running on AWS using a Duck DNS system . Reflection . Duck DNS is useful for our projects and works by projects that involve remote access or control of a device, such as setting up a home security camera, remote desktop access, or hosting a website or game server from a home network. By using Duck DNS, the device or service can be accessed using a static hostname, which is more convenient than having to remember or constantly look up the device’s changing IP address. Also, Duck DNS is easy to set up and does not require any special hardware or software. It can be configured to update the IP address automatically, making it a reliable and low-maintenance solution for dynamic IP addresses. Steps are to create a free account, choose hostname, configure to update IP address with DuckDNS own domain name, and test hostname through browser. Duck DNS is a useful tool for any project that requires a static hostname for remote access or control of a device or service. Duck DNS is a unique tool because it is simple and is integrated with other automation services. .",

The identified procedure, getNutritionInfo gathers the nutrition facts from the API. The function gets passed in the query and results in data of the searched food. This contributes to the overall functionality of the program because the calorie data is being gathered to help the user receive the requested calorie information. In terms of classes, I made a food class, Food and decoder class, and FoodDecoder in order to decode the JSON. I have multiple functions in my code, getNutritionInfo, home, and result. In my frontend, I made a table organizing the name of food and calories of food data. The technique I used to make the table was a for loop that went through the nameFoodList list. In my Backend, I made a result route and I used a parameter in the getNutritionInfo function. The function getNutritionInfo gets the query from the user and calls the API and as a result the API returns the food data. . Describe Data Abstraction, discussion on data used and data structures to support project: JSON, Dictionaries, Lists, and/or Database Tables. | . The name of the variable representing the list being used in this response is nameFoodList. The data contained in this list represents all the foods the user is inputting into the search bar and storing them in the program. The data I used was an API that provides data about the amount of calories in any food. Data structures I used to support my project are JSON, dictionaries, lists, and tuples. I used a dictionary, foodDict, to support my project, which is storing what the user is inputting into the search field. I used JSON as well and I converted the JSON into the food object that I made. In addition, I used a list, nameFoodList to store the names of the foods the user types into the search bar. Finally, I used tuples, I made a list of tuples to group together the name of the food and the calories of that food. . Describe Usage of Control Structures, ie Iteration and Conditional Statements. Areas where you use lists and interation in Frontend Display. Areas were you decide and execulte different paths of code, for instance Create vs Read vs Update vs Delete. Also, show a function where a different parameter or condition causes a differen result. | . My usage of control structures consists of conditional statements specifically if statements. I used an if statement in my routing code for my search bar, so when the user opens the website there are no numbers in the calorie calculator. It ensures previous data is not stored, and only new data is stored. I also used an if statement for the printed data table on the bottom. This if statement ensures that when the user initially opens the website, there is no data showing up. There will only be an empty table, with headers, Name of Food and Calories of Food. Areas where I use lists are nameFoodList. I used a list of tuples consisting of the name of food and calories for that food. I also used an iteration in Frontend Display.

The distribution of responsibilities is naturally divided between the frontend and backend. The frontend consists of the user interface, which includes the visual elements of the application that the user interacts with. The backend consists of the server-side components of the application, like the database, APIs, and business logic and manages and processes data. This distribution allows for the frontend and backend simplify development and improve maintainability. It allows for flexibility in technologies used for each piece, as the frontend and backend can be developed independently and communicate through well-defined interfaces. .

Researchers have developed a simulation of packets traveling between server computers and client computers in a network. Of the following, which two outcomes are most likely to be results of the simulation? . My answer: Better understanding of the effect of temporarily unavailable network connections AND Better understanding of the effect of using hexadecimal representations for binary data. . Correct answer: Better understanding of the effect of temporarily unavailable network connections AND Better understanding of the impact of increased connection speeds for frequently visited servers. . Notes: I misread this question, I meant to select option D as well. However, accidentally missed clicking option B. I need to start going back and checking my answers at the end. . Question 23 . Computers are often used to search through large sets of data to find useful patterns in the data. Which of the following tasks is NOT an example where searching for patterns is needed to produce useful information? . My answer: An online retailer analyzing customers’ viewing habits to suggest other products based on the purchasing history of other customers . Correct answer: A high school analyzing student grades to identify the students with the top ten highest grade point averages . Notes: It’s not neccesary to find a pattern to make use of student grades, therefore, one can find the average and higest to understand all the students. . Question 26 . Which of the following is a true statement about data compression? . My answer: Regardless of the compression technique used, once a data file is compressed, it cannot be restored to its original state. . Correct answer: There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data. . Notes: Data compression is used for files stored on local storage media.Different compression techniques have different advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of technique depends on different factors. . Question 29 . An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences? . My answer: 2 more items can be uniquely identified. . Correct answer: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified. . Notes: The 6-bit binary sequences allows for 26 or 64 different items to be identified while the 7-bit binary sequences allows for 27 or 128 different items to be identified. . Question 32 . Some programming languages use constants, which are variables that are initialized at the beginning of a program and never changed. Which of the following are good uses for a constant? . I. To represent the mathematical value π(pi) as 3.14 II. To represent the current score in a game III. To represent a known value such as the number of days in a week . My answer: I and II only . Correct answer: I and III only . Notes: I thought the game score would remain constant because I interperted it as each variable having its own constant value in the beginning. . Question 33 . Which of the following can be represented by a single binary digit? Select two answers. . My answer: The remainder when dividing a whole number by 2 . Correct answer: The remainder when dividing a whole number by 2 AND The value of a Boolean variable. . Notes: When dividing a number by two, it is going to be 0 or 1/2. Thus, these two values can be represented in a single binary digit. So, 0;0, and 1/2;1. . Question 39 . Which of the following CANNOT be displayed as a result of executing the code segment? .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . A duplicate key = collision | No need to hash in python dictionary | . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # Only numbers 1, 2, 3 were printed and it got rid of all the dupilicate values. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # I think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables because a set of numbers are released and there are no duplicates. . {1, 2, 3} .

My role: Frontend | My feature: Your Likes Page Goal: To keep track of what landmarks and activities users like and keeps and organizes user’s progress in one place | . | . How my feature fits the Collegeboard Criteria? . Category Criteria How it fits the criteria? . Program Purpose and Function | ✅ describes the overall purpose of the program demonstrated in the video ✅ describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video ✅ describes the input and output of the program | The Your Likes page will keep track of progress made on the website and keep it in one place and organized. | . Data Abstraction | ✅ one program code that shows how data has been stored in this list (or another collection type). ✅ one program code that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. ✅ identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. ✅ describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program | The Your Likes page will include activities and landmarks they want to do and visit will be stored in a separate list. | . Managing Complexity | ✅ includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program  ✅ explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. | Without storing this information in a list, the user could not properly use our website to plan their trip with specialized activities. | . Procedural Abstraction | ✅ one program code showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure ✅ one program code showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. ✅ describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program | The Your Likes page will use the procedure of users hearting an item and contribute to the functionality of the program, which is to find activites to do and places to go to. | . Algorithm Implementation | ✅ includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration ✅ explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it | The Your Likes page will use iterations because the user will have to repeat the action of hearting a item in order for it to add to the Your Likes page and to be stored in the table database. | . Testing | ✅ describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.✅ describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. ✅ identifies the result of each call | The Your Likes page will be built first, and then be tested in order to pass different arguments. | . How I plan to finish my CPT project? . I plan to finish my CPT project by diligently working on it each week I will communicate with my CPT Tri 2 group because I need some of their parts to work in order for my feature to work. | I will set goals each week in order to make progress each week. | I will set small and final deadlines for myself. | I will keep myself accountable by working with my group members. I will ensure my teammates are making progress on their project each week and they will keep me accountable in return. | I will work with a positive and resilient attitude too because I know at times I will be frustrated and annoyed with completing the CPT. | . | .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . A programmer should care about space and time complexity because space and time determines how fast a program runs and works. Users would want to use programs that are efficient and effective because they would not want to wait for a program to load since it buffers or loads. | .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 2.2496440410614014 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 3.7795002460479736 seconds .

Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . Time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm because they have a direct impact on the efficiency and performance of the algorithm. The time complexity provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm&#39;s running time. An algorithm with a lower time complexity is generally more efficient than one with a higher time complexity, it can process larger inputs in a shorter amount of time. Space complexity provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm&#39;s memory usage. An algorithm with lower space complexity uses less memory and is more efficient than higher space complexity. Since it can process larger inputs with limited memory resources. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | . No, you should not always use a constant time algorithm or use an exponential time algorithm. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the available resources. Constant time algorithms have a fixed running time that does not depend on the size of the input. They are efficient and suitable for problems where the size of the input is not a significant factor. They are not the best for problems with large inputs and unknown input sizes. Exponential time algorithms have running times that grows exponentially with the size of the input. They are less efficient than constant time algorithms and are used for where there are no known polynomial time algorithms. Exponential time algorithms are also the only viable option for solving a problem. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Some general patterns that I noticted to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity include looping, recursion, sorting, searching, and data structures. The loop is usually proportional to the number of iterations of the loop. A recursive algorithm is often related to the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm. Recursive algorithms have a space complexity of O(n) if the depth of the recursion is proportional to the size of the input. Sorting algorithms have a time complexity of at least O(n log n) and the lower bound for comparison-based sorting algorithms. Searching algorithms have a time complexity of O(log n) for binary search and O(n) for linear search. The space complexity of an algorithm that uses data structures, such as arrays or hash tables, is often proportional to the size of the data structure. .

Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . It is like a category. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | . The purpose of identity Column in SQL database is to organize the information and data. . What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | . Primary piece should be unique, such as an ID number. . What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . Integer, string, images, text, lists, dictionary, class, and boolean. . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | . A connection object is an object that connects two objects together. Ater Googleing it, connection object is an instance of a connection class that represents a connection between a program and a database. It contains information about the database, such as the server address, database name, authentication details, and other parameters needed to establish a connection. . Same for cursor object? | . A cursor object is an instance of a cursor class that allows a program to interact with the database by executing SQL commands and retrieving results. It maintains the current position in the result set and provides methods to navigate and modify the data. . Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | . The cursor object may have attributes such as the SQL statement being executed, the result set, the number of rows affected, and the position in the result set. Conn objects include the database driver, connection parameters, status, and transaction state. . Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . &quot;Results&quot; is a variable that holds data returned from a database query, it could be an object if the data is returned, which is known in the form of a collection or a custom class instance. . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() . Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | . Object oriented programming is different and is organized. It is bigger too. However imperative might be better when doing a small action. . Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . The purpse of SQL INSERT is to add new rows of data inot a database. No, it is not the same as User init because it initializes the class&#39;s attributes. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your UID:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your DOB &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() create() . A new user record amitha31 has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | . The hacked part tells users that they have been hacked due to their weak password that consists of two characters. Ultimately, it simply communicates to the user they have been hacked and suggests to change the password and to make their password stronger by adding special characters and create a password that ranges 8 to 20 characters. . Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . A try/except block is used in Python to catch and handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. The code inside the try block is executed normally, and if an exception is raised, the code inside the corresponding except block is executed to handle the exception. It happens due to syntax errors, a type error, or a runtime errors. The except block will occur when an exception is raised during the execution of the try block. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . Code that seems to be repeated in each of these examples is the conn in and conn out. It is repeated because it is the function that creates a connection to the SQLite table and returns a SQLite connection object. In other words, it is the function that connects the SQLite table and the user ID, names, passwords, and dates of birth. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter UID to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;Hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while getting the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() update() . The row with user id amitha31 the password has been successfully updated . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | . I think the DELETE function is a dangerous operation certain times, however, not all times because in some coding situations it is neccesary. For this instance, since we are working with users and adding, updating, and deleting users, the DELETE function is neccesary. Therefore, the DELETE function is neccessary at some times, but not needed and dangerous at some times. . In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . In the print statements, the &quot;f&quot; refers to the order and to print the user ID number first. The {uid} function refers to the user ID number being printed. It tells the code to print the user ID number along with the corresponding message the code prints with the uid code and &quot;f&quot; function. . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() delete() . The row with uid amitha31 was successfully deleted . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | . The menu repeats specific functions that are needed no matter what for the Python code to function and work properly. The menu repeats the import sqlite3 function in order to import the sqlite3 functions and table with users. Another function that is repeated in the menu continuously is the def function, the def function is repeated each code cell and is followed by a different function depending on the purpose of the code cell. . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . Yes, one can refactor this menu and additionally can make it work with a List because this code is built that way. The way the code is written helps and allows one to refactor because of the functions used in the code cell. . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . No uid amitha31 was not found in the table No uid amitha31 was not found in the table No uid was not found in the table . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site.

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . The choice of image metadata and considerations can affect the file size, quality, and compatibility of an image. For instance, using a higher resolution or color depth can improve the image fidelity but also increase the file size and processing time. Using lossy compression can save space but also introduce artifacts or distortions in the image. Therefore, it&#39;s important to balance these factors according to the intended use and audience of the image. Higher resolution means more detail and sharpness but also larger file size. The height and width of an image can affect its aspect ratio and composition. . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories .

Question 10: Which of the following activities poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk? | My answer: Making a purchase at an online store that uses public key encryption to transmit credit card information . Correct answer: Reserving a hotel room by e-mailing a credit card number to a hotel . Notes: Public key encryption is used in this question and it is when a key is used to encrypt and decrypt information. Therefore, an email goes through the Internet and routers, which read the content of the email, and thus, credit card numbers are read from the email. . Question 21: | . My answer: The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended. . Correct answer: The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct. . Notes: There is an iteration blocj for the FOR EACH loop, which made it confusing for me and brought me to a different conclusion. . Question 22: | . My answer: Neither grid I nor grid II . Correct answer: Grid I only . Notes: With the goal of getting the robot to reach the gray square, grid 1 is correctly programmed because the robot moves forward, turns right, turns right, turns left, turns left, moves forward, moves forward, turns left, turns left, and moves forward. All these steps get the robot to the gray square. . Question 29: | My answer: true false true . Correct answer: false false false . Notes: Due to the “NOT a OR b AND c” portion in the code, it results in “false false false.” . Question 30: In the following expression, the variable truckWeight has the value 70000 and the variable weightLimit has the value 80000. truckWeight &lt; weightLimit What value does the expression evaluate to? My answer: false | Correct answer: true . Notes: I misread this question and should have checked my answer to this question again because the expression is false due to 7000 &lt; 8000. . Question 38: | My answer: IF(num &lt; 0) { DISPLAY(“negative”) } ELSE { DISPLAY(“positive”) } IF(num = 0) { DISPLAY(“zero”) } Correct answer: IF(num &lt; 0) { DISPLAY(“negative”) } ELSE { IF(num = 0) { DISPLAY(“zero”) } ELSE { DISPLAY(“positive”) } } Notes: The answer I chose is wrong because of the greater than and less than signs used in the answer of code I chose. It is inequivalent because the display code is incorrect. . Question 40: | . My answer: Replace ROTATE_RIGHT with ROTATE_LEFT. . Correct answer: No change is needed; the algorithm is correct as is. . Notes: I misread the code in this image, so there are no changes to be made to the code because the robot can reach the gray square with the programmed code. . Question 45: Which of the following are benefits of procedural abstraction? Select two answers. | My answer: . Procedural abstraction eliminates the need for programmers to document their code. | Procedural abstraction provides an opportunity to give a name to a block of code that describes the purpose of the code block. | . Correct answer: . Procedural abstraction makes it easier for people to read computer programs. | Procedural abstraction provides an opportunity to give a name to a block of code that describes the purpose of the code block. | . Notes: Procedural abstraction is the seperation of the logical properties of an action from the detials of how the action is implemented. . Question 49: A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose? | My answer: The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used. . Correct answer: The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement. . Notes: Using a simulation for this purpose would be useful because the details make it simple to implement. .",

            "title": "Trimester 2 Night @ the Museum Reflection",
            "content": "Self Reflection . In my opinion, I think I could have worked more efficiently on my feature because initially when I needed help coding something I would research and read websites. So, during class time I would be reading websites on how to fix an error or code a part of my feature, which was inefficient for me spefically because I would not find what I was looking for. Two class periods later, I remembered to use YouTube and watch tutorials, which saved me time and I found that I learn easier with watching videos than reading and absorbing information in APCSP. I just think I could have been more productive with my time some class periods, but as the frontend developer I believe I worked hard. . Group Reflection . My group presented our website to parents and students walking by. We showed them a run through of our website, afterwards we explained our purpose and goal of our website. Some people asked questions on how he did a certain feature on our website and whoever’s feature they asked about, that person responded. My group met outside of class time multiple times over the weekends and after school. However, we all sort of kept on falling behind on the project. For my feature, I was not able to develop much because my feature was connected to another group member’s feature, so I did as much as I could of developing my feature but could not meet all the criteria of my feature due to it relying on another feature’s completion. . Other CTE Classes . When I went to Night at the Museum I also looked around at the other CTE classes. I looked the Photography class, 3D Animation, AP Art, Ceramics, Drawing and Painting, Choir, and Mixed Media. I am also part of another CTE class, AP Studio Art, so I also looked at the artwork there. I really enjoyed looking at the other classes work and everything they have been working on for the trimester. Seeing all the pottery the ceramics class was fun considering how detailed the pieces are. . These are a few pictures of everything I saw while looking around: . . Other APCSP Projects . . I looked at a few groups’ APCSP websites for this project. One of the feature’s I saw on this group’s website was a trivia quiz/game. They had trivia questions such as name four countries that start with the letter U. I thought this was interactive and engaging to have a game on the website. . . One of the feature’s this group included on their website was the popular game Wordle. Their website was cat cafe themed, they had a cat Wordle as well as a memory game on their website. Their frontend looked really good and everything was functioning very well on their website. . . This group has a fast dating website, so they had users take a quiz and it was interactive and engaging. I really liked their frontend and how appealing their website looked and their website was also functioning pretty well. . Conclusion . Ultimately, Night at the Museum was a great experience and it was fun presenting my group’s projects and seeing what my classmates are working on too. Something that can be improved upon at Night at the Museum is the organization and format of presentations in the classrooms. Everyone in the class is clumped together and it is difficult to tell apart groups and their projects. I think having a structure to where each group stands in the classroom would significantly improve the Computer Science Principles class at Night at the Museum. Having a structure when people walk through will help APCSP students as well as parents and other students coming in to look at presentations. Since they know where to go and navigate the classroom to see presentations and it is not just a clump of people you have to go through and ask them to give you their presentation. .

For my group’s Collegeboard Performance Task, we are going to create a travel website where users can plan their trip in the San Diego County area and choose landmarks to visit. This will help with time and budget management. Our primary audience for our website are tourists and San Diego county residents that are finding something to do or see. I am going to be working on the Your Likes page, which is where users can keep track of what landmarks and activities they like by simply clicking a heart shaped button. . Code Plan . The coding plan for the Your Likes page aims for any time a user hearts soemthing, the item will be stored in a table database. We plan to use Python to save the user’s progress as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition, we will be implementing CRUD into the Your Likes page: Create: User inputs their details for the trip in a filter and data will be saved, Read: usrs can access their like page which is saved each time, Update and Delete; users can remove liked landmarks/activities in narrowing down places or they could add more. . Video Plan . In my writeup and video, I plan to use the Collegeboard criteria to clearly and expliclity get acorss my idea to the grader and others. I will test the feature, Your Likes page and do a run through demonstration while simotaneuosly describing and explaining the iterations, procedures, and algorithms I used.

The AND Boolean operator refers to all of the conditions, which is incorrect in this situation. Whereas, the OR Boolean operator refers to ensuring one out of the many conditions are true. Therefore, in this situation we would need to use a OR Boolean operator. . Question 17: | . My answer: . . | . | . | Correct answer: . . | . | . | Notes: . | . The Boolean variable value 1 and value 2 are using and applying the &quot;AND&quot;. This question has two corrrect answers. . Question 26: | . My answer: . | . | Correct answer: . | . | Notes: . | . I missed the part that was talking about the mystery value which is indicated as &quot;p&quot; in the picture, so I just used the statements to answer my question. However, the robot is actually moving in different segments that are repeated: move forward, move forward, and rotate right. . Question 27: | . My answer: . | . | Correct answer: . | . | Notes: After reading this question I just realized the cursor needs to move forward a certain amount of times, then turn, instead of first moving forward and rotating. . | . Question 28: | . My answer: . | . | Correct answer: . | | . | Notes: . | . There are two correct answers for this question, and I got one out of the two correct answers are correct. There is a loop, which repeats four times to move forward, left, forward, and right in order to accomplish its mission. While the other choice has two inner loops in order to move forward, forward, and left to accomplish its mission. . Question 33: | . My answer: Neither algorithm will correctly identify the maximum value when the input contains both positive and negative input values. | Correct answer: Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to − 1. . | Notes: . | . I did not understand this question because I could not remember what a algorithm was. An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. Using this information, algorithm 2 will return the maximum value. . How I understood and learned from the questions I got wrong? . In order to understand and learn from the questions I got wrong, I found exercises and videos on Khan Academy. I spent time watching the Khan Academy videos and afterwards I took the quizzes: . Algorithms . Iterations, Lists, &amp; Loops . Booleans . Reflection . Overall, I think I performed pretty well on this MCQ. The majority of the questions I got wrong were because I did not read the question fully or did not understand a vocabulary term used in the question. Therefore, I will be practicing and gain a deeper understanding of the vocabulary terms. I will try doing this by using Quizlet, Khan Academy practice, and watching videos on YouTube. Ultimately, I believe I am solid and fully understand the majority of the concepts we have learned thus far in APCSP. .",

            "content": "5.1 Hacks . Blog Post Reflection . 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing. . Three of my own beneficial effects of computing include: increasing your productivity, keeping you connected to the world, and connecting you to the internet. Although there are beneficial effects to computing there are harmful effects to computing. Computing can increase your productivity, however, it is also easy to be distracted by something else on your computer. One can be distracted by messages, games, and social media apps on their computer. Overall, leading to a decrease in one’s productivity and porosity levels. Computing can keep you connected to the world, however, being connected to the world comes up with issues like experiencing human traffickers and hackers online. Computing can keep you connected to the internet, but the internet has several disadvantages and harms such as addictions, spam, hacks, and viruses. . 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Something that is impacting my personal study and success in High School is the Advanced Placement courses I take and the activities and extracurriculars I do outside of school. I am often occupied with something which is a blessing and curse because being free with nothing to do puts me in my thoughts. However, having so much to do is bad for my mental health and contributes to my stress levels. I mainly just struggle with having so much on my plate and juggling all my responsibilties. In order to be less stressed I take time to myself each day and priotize going on a walk or going on a run to relax my body and mind. Setting time aside each day for myself has signifcantly helped and helps me get my mind off anything. It is overall really helpful to step outside into the nature and helps me rejuvenate. . 5.2 Hacks . Blog Post Reflection – Digital Empowerment . 1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by not relying on technology. They can engage and empower themselves by going outside into nature and finding an acuity they enjoy. In order to be less attached to technology, one can also set limits and make use of the Apple screen time feature. This way they will have an idea of how long they spend their time looking at a screen. This would significantly help one because it would reduce the amount of blue light exposure to their eyes overall improving and better their life and mood. One can also use features such as night shift on their digital devices or even adjust the screen brightness on their phone. So, it does not affect their retina too much. . 2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by encouraging them to decrease and adjust their screen brightness on their digital devices. Additionally, telling someone the changes they have noticed in their life after reducing brightness and screen time can help persuade them to also consider reducing blue lights from screens. Something that I could do at Del Norte High School is reminding students to decrease their screen time and screen brightness. I would tell them to spend time doing things they love that do not involve using or looking at a screen. Additionally, I think counselors or the Del Norte High School team can give presentations or a lesson plan to teachers to present to students. I think implementing things on paper can also potentially help students because it reduces the amount of bluelight they are exposed to by spending time on their phones for social media or doing homework. . 3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Yes, I think red tape is blocking digital empowerment because the government is constantly trying to protect us from dangerous or violent things. The government protecting us is nice, however, I think it is also good for people to have access to things because the government hiding certain stuff it almost creates a feeling of danger for some. Since it seems like something is being hidden from you, and you will never figure out what it is. Yes, I think there are such barriers at Del Norte High School too because as a student you know information about a certain area. However, there is so much information students do not know because the school does not release or announce a lot of information. For example, several families donate money to the school, but paying to go on field trips still costs a lot. I also think red tape hides stuff elsewhere too. . 5.3 Hacks . 1. Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . After watching the YouTube video about HP, HP intentionally is racist because they only tested with dominantly white people. They should have tested with a more diverse selection of individuals, in order for the camera to facially recognize those with darker skin. HP should have done a better job testing considering that they are a huge company they should have done a signifcantly better testing job. Due to their exclusive selection of people while testing has led them here. This is only disadvantegeous and harmful to HP because now they have a group of people who do not support their company and will not buy their HP computers. One can avoid bias in their algorithms or code they write by testing with a diverse group of people and ultimately focusing and priortizing diversity in their code. This way they can avoid bias and have a product or item that has a large audience. . 5.4 Hacks . 1. Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in you project … CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsource idea and how I might initiate it in our environment is based on Night at the Museum. At Night at the Museum, we can set up a raffle system at the entrance where each parent, student, or individual receives a raffle ticket when they walk in order to ensure each person gets a raffle ticket. This way we will be able to reach a larger and diverse audience, which is perfect because this way we can reduce computer bias. . 2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Del Norte High School crowdsourcing can be beneficial because the school has thousands of students which would help to do the crowdsourcing procedure. We can obtain the information we need from the Del Norte High School students and use that information towards our project. Yes, my project could be better with crowdsourcing because getting people’s input and opinion about how they search for activiites to do and places to go to in San Diego county. Hearing their valuable inputs can help improve my project and helps me improve the user’s experience on my website. . 3. What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . Data I can capture at Night at the Museum is how people search for activities to do and places to go to in San Diego County and also using it as a marketing technique can tremendously help. Showing people our website and guiding them around the website and the features they website has can help us gain the opinions of users. This way through user input we can improve the website and change it to better it since that is our goal and purpose to keep track of what landmarks and activities users like and keeps and organizes user’s progress in one place. . 5.5 Hacks . 1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . These are all the license types that one can chose when creating a GitHub repository: Apache License 2.0, GNU General Public License v3.0, MIT License, BSD 2-Clause “Simplified” License, BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License, Boost Software License 1.0, Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Eclipse Public License 2.0, GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, GNU General Public License v2.0, GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1, Mozilla Public License 2.0, and The Unlicense. . 2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . The discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical that we discussed in class today are how having licenses prevents us from getting hacks and data breaches. Licenses like GitHub licenses encrypt keep our information safe. Also, this is why Google has two factor authentication to ensure that it is the actual person logging in and accessing their information and accounts. . 3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. . Personal Blog License . Group Blog License . For both my personal and group blog, I chose to use a MIT license because anyone could use it and could be credited. My group’s blog and my personal blog, are both blogs I do not plan to profit off of, which is why I specfically chose to use an MIT blog since in this case it makes the most sense to do so. . 5.6 Hacks . 1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . Personal Identifiable Information (PII) I have seen on a project in AP CompSci Principles is GitHub. Each student’s GitHub account appears when they search their name and their GitHub account shows their projects and repositories. Since we use other programs and softwares in APCSP like Postman, AWS, or Slack, these softwares use PII measures such as encryption, secure storage, access controls, and data minimization in order to keep information safe. . 2. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . My perosonal feelings about PII are mixed. I like it in terms of it pulling up my LinkedIn when someone searches my name, however, I do not like it in terms of it pulling up personal information like my address, passwords, or phone numbers. For others, I think it is also a problem to them because of their social media. They would not want their social media accounts to appear along with their professional work since it would degrade their professional view. . 3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . A good password is one that is strong and secure, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to guess or crack. Strong passwords usually are lengthier, complex, and unique. Whereas, weak passwords include one’s personal information, small amount of characters, and simple. . 4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . Symmetric encryption uses a single secret key to both encrypt and decrypt data. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption and it is used to scramble the data into an unreadable form, and the receiver uses the same key to unscramble the data and access the original message. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt the data. The public key can be freely shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret. When someone wants to send an encrypted message to the owner of the public key, they use the public key to encrypt the data. The owner of the private key is the only one who can decrypt the data, since only they have access to the private key. . 5. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . One example of encryption used in AWS deployment is the encryption of data stored in Amazon S3, which is a scalable and durable object storage service. In Amazon S3, one can enable server-side encryption for objects by specifying an encryption algorithm and is done using Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) encryption. With SSE-KMS, specifying a customer master key stored in AWS Key Management Service to encrypt the data, there is more security and encryption. . 6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . A phishing scheme I have learned about the hard way are fake login pages that looks like the login page of a website. The user puts in their information thinking it is the actual website asking for login credentials. However, a hacker behind the scenes is taking record of the credentials and is using it in the wrong ways. Some phishing techniques include gathering information about the one through social media and public records and using this information to their advantage. Another phishing technique includes creating a fake email or message that appears to be from someone they know. While the person on the other side is prompted to take action or provide personal information. .",

HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . A decidable problem is a problem for which algorithms can be written to solve and produce a correct output for all inputs and an example of a decidable problem is if a store bought 100 apples, then their balance would be 100 apples. Whereas an undecidable problem is a problem for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution. An example of an undecidable problem is if you were given a computer program that calculates grades, the user will input their current grade. So, the program will loop forever until the user receives their output. . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 &lt;/p&gt; C. is correct because a 3 step algorithm consists of when there is a variable multiplied by an integer, all to the power of 2. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Input In [5] function peak_finder(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Answer: . function peak_finder2(array){ if (array.length)=== 0{ return `Array cannot be empty` }else if (array.length === 1){ return array[0] }else{ let mid_index = Math.floor(array.length*0.5) if (array[mid_index +1]&gt;array[mid_index]){ return peak_finding(array.slice(mid_index + 1 )) }else if (array[mid_index -1]&gt;array[mid_index]){ new=array.reverse().slice(mid_index+1).reverse() return peak_finding(new) }else{ return array[mid_index] } } } . Input In [6] function peak_finder2(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . I attempted doing this hack, however, I got stuck and did not understand so, I looked the answer to gain a better understanding. After, looking at the answer I noticed how the code in the answer is condensed in a simpler and shortened format and way, however still has the same function. In addition, the answer code does not set the peak, counter, and peak_index to 0 since using the counter function already assumes that it begins at the value 0 and that there is no reason in for typing in the 0. There are also array.slice and mid_index, which I observed were being used in substitution for the if else statement. The if else command is also used to reverse the array and to find the peak. Ultimately, the code is written in a shortened and simpler format in order to be efficient and easily understand for the user. . HACK 4: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . Answer: . givendata = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] print(&quot;data unsorted:&quot;, givendata) print (&quot;.....&quot;) givendata.sort() print(&quot;data sorted&quot;, givendata) . data unsorted: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] ..... data sorted [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Here, I used the Python function &quot;sort&quot; to order the list of number from lowest to greatest. . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Answer: . from itertools import permutations # import permutations with library function data = [1,2,3] # all the possible permutations for a in permutations(data): print(a) # print permutations . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . In this code, I imported the permutation function from the library itertools, so I can make the permutation command. Then, I used a loop so I can iterate all the potential permutations to print permutations. . Reflection . In this section, I learned about all the different types of algorithms. I learned the difference between each one and how to use new Python functions. I learned how different algorithms differ from each other and also when to use certain algorithms and when not to use them. Since particular algorithms are used based on situation by situation. The lesson was also presented well, all the examples were extremely helpful and helped me understand the material and complete the hacks thoroughly. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

From today&#39;s lesson on Sections 14 and 15, I learned about libraries and the different functions I can use to create randomization. I learned that libraries are useful in terms of simplfying a program and being more efficient when doing so. Using documentation is helpful when writing code because you can easily refer to it and understand it easily for yourself or even when helping others. There are multiple random. functions which help generate values in different. The random. functions are random.item, shuffle, and randint, which all have a different function and are used in different cases. In terms of how the lesson, I think I grasped the topics easily and understood the content thoroughly due to how the lesson was organized and taught. It was taught in a organized way and .

D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random Explanation: This is not part of the random library because you cannot random a random.&lt;/p&gt; C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? | The advantage of using libraries is that libraries help simplify complex programs and they also collect prewritten code and procedures. Libraries also help maximize their efficiency too. . Write a thorough documentation of the following code. | import random #random library imported in order to use it&#39;s functions names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) #inputs names to make a list of names names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) #splits everyone&#39;s names with commas num_items = len(names) #creates a list of names random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) #pick a random choice from a list of strings person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] #chooses random name print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) #output received . j is going to buy the meal today! .

EXTRA-CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: . Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points. This will not likely be the only way to get a perfect score, however. . &lt;/div&gt; . | | | .",

Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because it makes it easier to find an item in a sorted list of items. It&#39;s more efficient because it works by continuously dividing half the proportion of the list , which could contain the item until it is narrowed down to one location. It is useful and efficient especially when there is a large set of data because it sorts it and finds the user’s final goal. Sequential search Is not as efficient as binary search because it finds a value in an unsorted array. However, if an array is sorted in the order of increasing value, then binary search is the most efficient and ideal way to go when approaching searching. . Question 9 .

How Many times will print(ln) be called? . for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) { for (var j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j++) { println(i * j); } } . Answer! [100 Times.The computer will execute the outer for loop 10 times (starting at i = 1 and ending after i = 10). Each time that it executes the outer loop, it will execute the inner for loop 10 times (starting at j = 1 and ending after j = 10). Each inner execution will call println() once.10 times 10 times 1 is 100, so the computer will call println() 100 times.] Practice . Consider the Following Code Segment. What is it initial value? What does the while loop check? . var numRabbits = 2; var numYears = 0; while (numRabbits &lt;= 100) { numRabbits += (numRabbits/2 * 30); numYears++; } . Answer!

Explanation: My answer choice is wrong because I got confused with the defintion of what a POP command does. A POP command removes the last item in a list. My confusion is now cleared up after this question, and this will help me better understand what a POP command does and its function. . Question 8 . Explanation: My answer choice is wrong because the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop does not iterate over an iterable and for a set amount of time and does not intuitively take an iterable or manipulate it over a set period using pointers. . Reflection . Initially, this lesson was difficult to understand because it was a very fast-paced lesson, which made it hard to follow along. Overall, it was a lesson that was difficult to understand while the information was being presented, however, after applying thr information I learned to the exercises and quizes, it put together all the information and it helped make sense in my mind. The exercises was helpful since it was practical and I had to type the code and watch it for mistakes. .",

A student with 3 issues and 1 complete scrumboard task would receive a score of 2.0 because they do not have atleast more than 5 scrumboard tasks. . Reflection: . After this lesson, I learned how to create and write a flowchart in pseudocode while given a scenario. I also learned how to use a dictionary and use nested conditionals. I learned how to use if and if-else statements, and the difference between the two. An if statement is when you go through certain statements if the if expression is true. Whereas, if-else statement are when you go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false. I learned how to read and interpret different types of operators, AND, OR, and not through the binary truth practice. The binary truth practice was difficult initially, however, I understood it after my group explained it to me. I followed a tutorial to use nested conditionals in my Python dictionary, which was helpful since I was new to using and coding nested conditionals. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Hello! . output explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: &quot;Hello, World!&quot; . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view element.text(msg); //alert(msg); . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function... There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: output * Description: The parameter is &quot;output&quot; to console and jupyter page */ function logIt(output) { console.log(output); element.append(output + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); //alert(output); } // First sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; logIt(msg); // Second sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, &lt;b&gt;Students&lt;/b&gt;!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2023-2024.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object and JSON . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. .

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",

On the way there, we all sang and danced to music. After one hour we got down in Little Italy and ate dinner at an Italian restaurant. I had lobster ravioli followed by tiramisu cake, which were both very good. After we finished with dinner, we went on the party bus on the way home and danced and sang.

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Data Compression . Lossy: (not discussed yet) | Lossless: (not discussed yet) | . Unit 3 Algorithm &amp; Programming . . Variables: an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values | Data Types: there are different data types; numeric, sequence, mapping, set | Assignment Operators: allows a program to change the value represented to a variable | . Managing Complexity with Variables . Lists: allow consistent computations and changing the number of variables and helps multiple items that are related to each other to be treated a single value | 2D Lists: two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory | Dictionaries: used to store data values in key:value pairs | Class: an outline for creating a new object | Algorithms: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer | Sequence: steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. | Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available | Iteration: repeating steps, or instructions over and over again | Expressions: combination of operators and operands | Comparison Operators: Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right AND Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right | .

Python For: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated | While loops with Range, with List: used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met | . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it does not, how it does it | Python Def procedures: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Parameters: input values of a procedure | Return Values: values that a function returns when it completes | .",
