I went to La Jolla beach with my friends and we walked around and found the La Jolla Observatory Deck, which is a hidden spot in San Diego. We watched the sunset from the deck and it was pretty. After, we went to Del Mar and got dinner in a food court. I had ramen with chicken and it tasted really good. The name of the restaurant is Marufuku ramen in Del Mar. After we ate dinner we went to One Paseo and got ice cream at Salt &amp; Straw. . Saturday: . I ran errands with my dad and drove him to each place he needed to go to because I have my permit, so I get in my driving practice while my dad gets his errands done. In the afternoon, I went to my best friend‚Äôs birthday party. She turned 17. Before the party, I went to my friend‚Äôs house and I got ready with her. Then, we both went to our friend‚Äôs house and met up with everyone. She got a party bus for everyone, so we took the party bus to Little Italy in San Diego Downtown. On the way there, we all sang and danced to music. After one hour we got down in Little Italy and ate dinner at an Italian restaurant. I had lobster ravioli followed by tiramisu cake, which were both very good. After we finished with dinner, we went on the party bus on the way home and danced and sang. I had a lot of fun and it was enjoyable. . Sunday: . I spent the day with my family. It started off with going to the farmer‚Äôs market with my parents. I had a chocolate almond croissant there and it has been my favorite croissant I have ever had in my life. Afterwards, I came back home and started doing my homework, which took almost until 9 PM. .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
