            "content": "Score . . Corrections . Question 2 . Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? | My answer: A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . Correct answer: A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . Notes: PNG uses a compression algorithm which keeps the picture’s original data without information/data being lost. Ultimately, lossy and lossless images use different types of compression algorithms. Using lossy compression can save space but also introduce artifacts or distortions in the image. . Question 21 . | . My answer: Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year AND Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer . Correct answer: Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year AND Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer . Notes: The correct sequence of steps should be organizing everything from least to greatest. The sequence I chose would not remove entries without an year, so the information and data in the spreadsheet would be inaccurate. . Reflection . I feel confident about the topics in Big Idea 2 and understand the concepts well. This can be seen through the score I got on the Big Idea 2 quiz. I received a 92% on the quiz and overall feel confident about Big Idea 2 by learning about it in class the past two weeks. .",

Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . It is like a category. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | . The purpose of identity Column in SQL database is to organize the information and data. . What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | . Primary piece should be unique, such as an ID number. . What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . Integer, string, lists, and boolean. . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

A connection object is an object that connects two objects together. Ater Googleing it, connection object is an instance of a connection class that represents a connection between a program and a database. It contains information about the database, such as the server address, database name, authentication details, and other parameters needed to establish a connection. . Same for cursor object? | . A cursor object is an instance of a cursor class that allows a program to interact with the database by executing SQL commands and retrieving results. It maintains the current position in the result set and provides methods to navigate and modify the data. . Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | . The cursor object may have attributes such as the SQL statement being executed, the result set, the number of rows affected, and the position in the result set. Conn objects include the database driver, connection parameters, status, and transaction state. . Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . &quot;Results&quot; is a variable that holds data returned from a database query, it could be an object if the data is returned, which is known in the form of a collection or a custom class instance. . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | . Object oriented programming is different and is organized. It is bigger too. However imperative might be better when doing a small action. . Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . The purpse of SQL INSERT is to add new rows of data inot a database. No, it is not the same as User init because it initializes the class&#39;s attributes. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . A try/except block is used in Python to catch and handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. The code inside the try block is executed normally, and if an exception is raised, the code inside the corresponding except block is executed to handle the exception. It happens due to syntax errors, a type error, or a runtime errors. . The except block will occur when an exception is raised during the execution of the try block. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) .

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . The choice of image metadata and considerations can affect the file size, quality, and compatibility of an image. For instance, using a higher resolution or color depth can improve the image fidelity but also increase the file size and processing time. Using lossy compression can save space but also introduce artifacts or distortions in the image. Therefore, it&#39;s important to balance these factors according to the intended use and audience of the image. Higher resolution means more detail and sharpness but also larger file size. The height and width of an image can affect its aspect ratio and composition. . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories .

Question 10: Which of the following activities poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk? | My answer: Making a purchase at an online store that uses public key encryption to transmit credit card information . Correct answer: Reserving a hotel room by e-mailing a credit card number to a hotel . Notes: Public key encryption is used in this question and it is when a key is used to encrypt and decrypt information. Therefore, an email goes through the Internet and routers, which read the content of the email, and thus, credit card numbers are read from the email. . Question 21: | . My answer: The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended. . Correct answer: The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct. . Notes: There is an iteration blocj for the FOR EACH loop, which made it confusing for me and brought me to a different conclusion. . Question 22: | . My answer: Neither grid I nor grid II . Correct answer: Grid I only . Notes: With the goal of getting the robot to reach the gray square, grid 1 is correctly programmed because the robot moves forward, turns right, turns right, turns left, turns left, moves forward, moves forward, turns left, turns left, and moves forward. All these steps get the robot to the gray square. . Question 29: | My answer: true false true . Correct answer: false false false . Notes: Due to the “NOT a OR b AND c” portion in the code, it results in “false false false.” . Question 30: In the following expression, the variable truckWeight has the value 70000 and the variable weightLimit has the value 80000. truckWeight &lt; weightLimit What value does the expression evaluate to? My answer: false | Correct answer: true . Notes: I misread this question and should have checked my answer to this question again because the expression is false due to 7000 &lt; 8000. . Question 38: | My answer: IF(num &lt; 0) { DISPLAY(“negative”) } ELSE { DISPLAY(“positive”) } IF(num = 0) { DISPLAY(“zero”) } Correct answer: IF(num &lt; 0) { DISPLAY(“negative”) } ELSE { IF(num = 0) { DISPLAY(“zero”) } ELSE { DISPLAY(“positive”) } } Notes: The answer I chose is wrong because of the greater than and less than signs used in the answer of code I chose. It is inequivalent because the display code is incorrect. . Question 40: | . My answer: Replace ROTATE_RIGHT with ROTATE_LEFT. . Correct answer: No change is needed; the algorithm is correct as is. . Notes: I misread the code in this image, so there are no changes to be made to the code because the robot can reach the gray square with the programmed code. . Question 45: Which of the following are benefits of procedural abstraction? Select two answers. | My answer: . Procedural abstraction eliminates the need for programmers to document their code. | Procedural abstraction provides an opportunity to give a name to a block of code that describes the purpose of the code block. | . Correct answer: . Procedural abstraction makes it easier for people to read computer programs. | Procedural abstraction provides an opportunity to give a name to a block of code that describes the purpose of the code block. | .

            "title": "Trimester 2 Night @ the Museum Reflection",
            "content": "Self Reflection . In my opinion, I think I could have worked more efficiently on my feature because initially when I needed help coding something I would research and read websites. So, during class time I would be reading websites on how to fix an error or code a part of my feature, which was inefficient for me spefically because I would not find what I was looking for. Two class periods later, I remembered to use YouTube and watch tutorials, which saved me time and I found that I learn easier with watching videos than reading and absorbing information in APCSP. I just think I could have been more productive with my time some class periods, but as the frontend developer I believe I worked hard. . Group Reflection . My group presented our website to parents and students walking by. We showed them a run through of our website, afterwards we explained our purpose and goal of our website. Some people asked questions on how he did a certain feature on our website and whoever’s feature they asked about, that person responded. My group met outside of class time multiple times over the weekends and after school. However, we all sort of kept on falling behind on the project. For my feature, I was not able to develop much because my feature was connected to another group member’s feature, so I did as much as I could of developing my feature but could not meet all the criteria of my feature due to it relying on another feature’s completion. . Other CTE Classes . When I went to Night at the Museum I also looked around at the other CTE classes. I looked the Photography class, 3D Animation, AP Art, Ceramics, Drawing and Painting, Choir, and Mixed Media. I am also part of another CTE class, AP Studio Art, so I also looked at the artwork there. I really enjoyed looking at the other classes work and everything they have been working on for the trimester. Seeing all the pottery the ceramics class was fun considering how detailed the pieces are. . These are a few pictures of everything I saw while looking around: . . Other APCSP Projects . . I looked at a few groups’ APCSP websites for this project. One of the feature’s I saw on this group’s website was a trivia quiz/game. They had trivia questions such as name four countries that start with the letter U. I thought this was interactive and engaging to have a game on the website. . . One of the feature’s this group included on their website was the popular game Wordle. Their website was cat cafe themed, they had a cat Wordle as well as a memory game on their website. Their frontend looked really good and everything was functioning very well on their website. . . This group has a fast dating website, so they had users take a quiz and it was interactive and engaging. I really liked their frontend and how appealing their website looked and their website was also functioning pretty well. . Conclusion . Ultimately, Night at the Museum was a great experience and it was fun presenting my group’s projects and seeing what my classmates are working on too. Something that can be improved upon at Night at the Museum is the organization and format of presentations in the classrooms. Everyone in the class is clumped together and it is difficult to tell apart groups and their projects. I think having a structure to where each group stands in the classroom would significantly improve the Computer Science Principles class at Night at the Museum. Having a structure when people walk through will help APCSP students as well as parents and other students coming in to look at presentations. Since they know where to go and navigate the classroom to see presentations and it is not just a clump of people you have to go through and ask them to give you their presentation. .

My answer: (onFloor1 AND callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1) . | Correct answer: (onFloor1 AND callTo2) OR (onFloor2 AND callTo1) . | Notes: . | . The AND Boolean operator refers to all of the conditions, which is incorrect in this situation. Whereas, the OR Boolean operator refers to ensuring one out of the many conditions are true. Therefore, in this situation we would need to use a OR Boolean operator. . Question 17: | . My answer: . . | . | . | Correct answer: . . | . | . | Notes: . | . The Boolean variable value 1 and value 2 are using and applying the &quot;AND&quot;. This question has two corrrect answers. . Question 26: | . My answer: . | . | Correct answer: . | . | Notes: . | . I missed the part that was talking about the mystery value which is indicated as &quot;p&quot; in the picture, so I just used the statements to answer my question. However, the robot is actually moving in different segments that are repeated: move forward, move forward, and rotate right. . Question 27: | . My answer: . | . | Correct answer: . | . | Notes: After reading this question I just realized the cursor needs to move forward a certain amount of times, then turn, instead of first moving forward and rotating. . | . Question 28: | . My answer: . | . | Correct answer: . | | . | Notes: . | . There are two correct answers for this question, and I got one out of the two correct answers are correct. There is a loop, which repeats four times to move forward, left, forward, and right in order to accomplish its mission. While the other choice has two inner loops in order to move forward, forward, and left to accomplish its mission. . Question 33: | . My answer: Neither algorithm will correctly identify the maximum value when the input contains both positive and negative input values. | Correct answer: Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to − 1. . | Notes: . | . I did not understand this question because I could not remember what a algorithm was. An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. Using this information, algorithm 2 will return the maximum value. . How I understood and learned from the questions I got wrong? . In order to understand and learn from the questions I got wrong, I found exercises and videos on Khan Academy. I spent time watching the Khan Academy videos and afterwards I took the quizzes: . Algorithms . Iterations, Lists, &amp; Loops . Booleans . Reflection . Overall, I think I performed pretty well on this MCQ. The majority of the questions I got wrong were because I did not read the question fully or did not understand a vocabulary term used in the question. Therefore, I will be practicing and gain a deeper understanding of the vocabulary terms. I will try doing this by using Quizlet, Khan Academy practice, and watching videos on YouTube. Ultimately, I believe I am solid and fully understand the majority of the concepts we have learned thus far in APCSP. .",

            "content": "5.1 Hacks . Blog Post Reflection . 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing. . Three of my own beneficial effects of computing include: increasing your productivity, keeping you connected to the world, and connecting you to the internet. Although there are beneficial effects to computing there are harmful effects to computing. Computing can increase your productivity, however, it is also easy to be distracted by something else on your computer. One can be distracted by messages, games, and social media apps on their computer. Overall, leading to a decrease in one’s productivity and porosity levels. Computing can keep you connected to the world, however, being connected to the world comes up with issues like experiencing human traffickers and hackers online. Computing can keep you connected to the internet, but the internet has several disadvantages and harms such as addictions, spam, hacks, and viruses. . 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Something that is impacting my personal study and success in High School is the Advanced Placement courses I take and the activities and extracurriculars I do outside of school. I am often occupied with something which is a blessing and curse because being free with nothing to do puts me in my thoughts. However, having so much to do is bad for my mental health and contributes to my stress levels. I mainly just struggle with having so much on my plate and juggling all my responsibilties. In order to be less stressed I take time to myself each day and priotize going on a walk or going on a run to relax my body and mind. Setting time aside each day for myself has signifcantly helped and helps me get my mind off anything. It is overall really helpful to step outside into the nature and helps me rejuvenate. . 5.2 Hacks . Blog Post Reflection – Digital Empowerment . 1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by not relying on technology. They can engage and empower themselves by going outside into nature and finding an acuity they enjoy. In order to be less attached to technology, one can also set limits and make use of the Apple screen time feature. This way they will have an idea of how long they spend their time looking at a screen. This would significantly help one because it would reduce the amount of blue light exposure to their eyes overall improving and better their life and mood. One can also use features such as night shift on their digital devices or even adjust the screen brightness on their phone. So, it does not affect their retina too much. . 2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by encouraging them to decrease and adjust their screen brightness on their digital devices. Additionally, telling someone the changes they have noticed in their life after reducing brightness and screen time can help persuade them to also consider reducing blue lights from screens. Something that I could do at Del Norte High School is reminding students to decrease their screen time and screen brightness. I would tell them to spend time doing things they love that do not involve using or looking at a screen. Additionally, I think counselors or the Del Norte High School team can give presentations or a lesson plan to teachers to present to students. I think implementing things on paper can also potentially help students because it reduces the amount of bluelight they are exposed to by spending time on their phones for social media or doing homework. . 3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Yes, I think red tape is blocking digital empowerment because the government is constantly trying to protect us from dangerous or violent things. The government protecting us is nice, however, I think it is also good for people to have access to things because the government hiding certain stuff it almost creates a feeling of danger for some. Since it seems like something is being hidden from you, and you will never figure out what it is. Yes, I think there are such barriers at Del Norte High School too because as a student you know information about a certain area. However, there is so much information students do not know because the school does not release or announce a lot of information. For example, several families donate money to the school, but paying to go on field trips still costs a lot. I also think red tape hides stuff elsewhere too. . 5.3 Hacks . 1. Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . After watching the YouTube video about HP, HP intentionally is racist because they only tested with dominantly white people. They should have tested with a more diverse selection of individuals, in order for the camera to facially recognize those with darker skin. HP should have done a better job testing considering that they are a huge company they should have done a signifcantly better testing job. Due to their exclusive selection of people while testing has led them here. This is only disadvantegeous and harmful to HP because now they have a group of people who do not support their company and will not buy their HP computers. One can avoid bias in their algorithms or code they write by testing with a diverse group of people and ultimately focusing and priortizing diversity in their code. This way they can avoid bias and have a product or item that has a large audience. . 5.4 Hacks . 1. Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in you project … CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsource idea and how I might initiate it in our environment is based on Night at the Museum. At Night at the Museum, we can set up a raffle system at the entrance where each parent, student, or individual receives a raffle ticket when they walk in order to ensure each person gets a raffle ticket. This way we will be able to reach a larger and diverse audience, which is perfect because this way we can reduce computer bias. . 2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Del Norte High School crowdsourcing can be beneficial because the school has thousands of students which would help to do the crowdsourcing procedure. We can obtain the information we need from the Del Norte High School students and use that information towards our project. Yes, my project could be better with crowdsourcing because getting people’s input and opinion about how they search for activiites to do and places to go to in San Diego county. Hearing their valuable inputs can help improve my project and helps me improve the user’s experience on my website. . 3. What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . Data I can capture at Night at the Museum is how people search for activities to do and places to go to in San Diego County and also using it as a marketing technique can tremendously help. Showing people our website and guiding them around the website and the features they website has can help us gain the opinions of users. This way through user input we can improve the website and change it to better it since that is our goal and purpose to keep track of what landmarks and activities users like and keeps and organizes user’s progress in one place. . 5.5 Hacks . 1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . These are all the license types that one can chose when creating a GitHub repository: Apache License 2.0, GNU General Public License v3.0, MIT License, BSD 2-Clause “Simplified” License, BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License, Boost Software License 1.0, Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Eclipse Public License 2.0, GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, GNU General Public License v2.0, GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1, Mozilla Public License 2.0, and The Unlicense. . 2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . The discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical that we discussed in class today are how having licenses prevents us from getting hacks and data breaches. Licenses like GitHub licenses encrypt keep our information safe. Also, this is why Google has two factor authentication to ensure that it is the actual person logging in and accessing their information and accounts. . 3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. . Personal Blog License . Group Blog License . For both my personal and group blog, I chose to use a MIT license because anyone could use it and could be credited. My group’s blog and my personal blog, are both blogs I do not plan to profit off of, which is why I specfically chose to use an MIT blog since in this case it makes the most sense to do so. . 5.6 Hacks . 1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . Personal Identifiable Information (PII) I have seen on a project in AP CompSci Principles is GitHub. Each student’s GitHub account appears when they search their name and their GitHub account shows their projects and repositories. Since we use other programs and softwares in APCSP like Postman, AWS, or Slack, these softwares use PII measures such as encryption, secure storage, access controls, and data minimization in order to keep information safe. . 2. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . My perosonal feelings about PII are mixed. I like it in terms of it pulling up my LinkedIn when someone searches my name, however, I do not like it in terms of it pulling up personal information like my address, passwords, or phone numbers. For others, I think it is also a problem to them because of their social media. They would not want their social media accounts to appear along with their professional work since it would degrade their professional view. . 3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . A good password is one that is strong and secure, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to guess or crack. Strong passwords usually are lengthier, complex, and unique. Whereas, weak passwords include one’s personal information, small amount of characters, and simple. . 4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . Symmetric encryption uses a single secret key to both encrypt and decrypt data. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption and it is used to scramble the data into an unreadable form, and the receiver uses the same key to unscramble the data and access the original message. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt the data. The public key can be freely shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret. When someone wants to send an encrypted message to the owner of the public key, they use the public key to encrypt the data. The owner of the private key is the only one who can decrypt the data, since only they have access to the private key. . 5. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . One example of encryption used in AWS deployment is the encryption of data stored in Amazon S3, which is a scalable and durable object storage service. In Amazon S3, one can enable server-side encryption for objects by specifying an encryption algorithm and is done using Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) encryption. With SSE-KMS, specifying a customer master key stored in AWS Key Management Service to encrypt the data, there is more security and encryption. . 6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . A phishing scheme I have learned about the hard way are fake login pages that looks like the login page of a website. The user puts in their information thinking it is the actual website asking for login credentials. However, a hacker behind the scenes is taking record of the credentials and is using it in the wrong ways. Some phishing techniques include gathering information about the one through social media and public records and using this information to their advantage. Another phishing technique includes creating a fake email or message that appears to be from someone they know. While the person on the other side is prompted to take action or provide personal information. .",

HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . A decidable problem is a problem for which algorithms can be written to solve and produce a correct output for all inputs and an example of a decidable problem is if a store bought 100 apples, then their balance would be 100 apples. Whereas an undecidable problem is a problem for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution. An example of an undecidable problem is if you were given a computer program that calculates grades, the user will input their current grade. So, the program will loop forever until the user receives their output. . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 &lt;/p&gt; C. is correct because a 3 step algorithm consists of when there is a variable multiplied by an integer, all to the power of 2. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Input In [5] function peak_finder(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Answer: . function peak_finder2(array){ if (array.length)=== 0{ return `Array cannot be empty` }else if (array.length === 1){ return array[0] }else{ let mid_index = Math.floor(array.length*0.5) if (array[mid_index +1]&gt;array[mid_index]){ return peak_finding(array.slice(mid_index + 1 )) }else if (array[mid_index -1]&gt;array[mid_index]){ new=array.reverse().slice(mid_index+1).reverse() return peak_finding(new) }else{ return array[mid_index] } } } . Input In [6] function peak_finder2(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . I attempted doing this hack, however, I got stuck and did not understand so, I looked the answer to gain a better understanding. After, looking at the answer I noticed how the code in the answer is condensed in a simpler and shortened format and way, however still has the same function. In addition, the answer code does not set the peak, counter, and peak_index to 0 since using the counter function already assumes that it begins at the value 0 and that there is no reason in for typing in the 0. There are also array.slice and mid_index, which I observed were being used in substitution for the if else statement. The if else command is also used to reverse the array and to find the peak. Ultimately, the code is written in a shortened and simpler format in order to be efficient and easily understand for the user. . HACK 4: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . Answer: . givendata = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] print(&quot;data unsorted:&quot;, givendata) print (&quot;.....&quot;) givendata.sort() print(&quot;data sorted&quot;, givendata) . data unsorted: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] ..... data sorted [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Here, I used the Python function &quot;sort&quot; to order the list of number from lowest to greatest. . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Answer: . from itertools import permutations # import permutations with library function data = [1,2,3] # all the possible permutations for a in permutations(data): print(a) # print permutations . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . In this code, I imported the permutation function from the library itertools, so I can make the permutation command. Then, I used a loop so I can iterate all the potential permutations to print permutations. . Reflection . In this section, I learned about all the different types of algorithms. I learned the difference between each one and how to use new Python functions. I learned how different algorithms differ from each other and also when to use certain algorithms and when not to use them. Since particular algorithms are used based on situation by situation. The lesson was also presented well, all the examples were extremely helpful and helped me understand the material and complete the hacks thoroughly. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

From today&#39;s lesson on Sections 14 and 15, I learned about libraries and the different functions I can use to create randomization. I learned that libraries are useful in terms of simplfying a program and being more efficient when doing so. Using documentation is helpful when writing code because you can easily refer to it and understand it easily for yourself or even when helping others. There are multiple random. functions which help generate values in different. The random. functions are random.item, shuffle, and randint, which all have a different function and are used in different cases. In terms of how the lesson, I think I grasped the topics easily and understood the content thoroughly due to how the lesson was organized and taught. It was taught in a organized way and .

D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random Explanation: This is not part of the random library because you cannot random a random.&lt;/p&gt; C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? | The advantage of using libraries is that libraries help simplify complex programs and they also collect prewritten code and procedures. Libraries also help maximize their efficiency too. . Write a thorough documentation of the following code. | import random #random library imported in order to use it&#39;s functions names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) #inputs names to make a list of names names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) #splits everyone&#39;s names with commas num_items = len(names) #creates a list of names random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) #pick a random choice from a list of strings person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] #chooses random name print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) #output received . j is going to buy the meal today! . (4) Coding Challenges! . REQUIRED: Create programs in python to complete the two task&lt;/p&gt; Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names | &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; import random names = [&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;Billy&quot;, &quot;Bobby&quot;, &quot;Sally&quot;, &quot;Sean&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Johnny&quot;, &quot;Jonny&quot;, &quot;Jonathan&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Joel&quot;, &quot;Jon&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;] for i in range(5): print(random.choice(names)) print(&quot;These are your 5 random names!&quot;) .

EXTRA-CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: . Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points. This will not likely be the only way to get a perfect score, however. . &lt;/div&gt; . | | | .",

Determine the number of iterations required to find a value in a data set. | Explain the requirements necessary to complete a binary search. | The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. | Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm | A binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data. | While using Binary Search you have to put the group of numbers from ascending or descending order | What the computer does it takes the lowest index and the highest index, adds them and then divides that value by 2. | This gets the middle value and starts the search at the middle of the group. | .

Question 4 . . Question 5 . Explain thorughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) . In order to find the number 69 in the list above, I would use the middle index, which is 4.5 and round it to 5. The fifth number in the sequence is 6, and 6 is less than 69. After finding the middle index, you have to find the first half middle index and second half middle index. The work for how I found the numbers of each index is shown in question 6. I used all the elements in the list given to find the number 69. . Question 6 . . Question 7 . Unsorted List of Strings . [“store”, ”Market”, ”Walmart”, &quot;Target”, ”Ralphs”] . Sorted List of Strings . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . Question 8 . Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search. . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because it makes it easier to find an item in a sorted list of items. It&#39;s more efficient because it works by continuously dividing half the proportion of the list , which could contain the item until it is narrowed down to one location. It is useful and efficient especially when there is a large set of data because it sorts it and finds the user’s final goal. Sequential search Is not as efficient as binary search because it finds a value in an unsorted array. However, if an array is sorted in the order of increasing value, then binary search is the most efficient and ideal way to go when approaching searching. . Question 9 . [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . . I&#39;m finding number 16 and it would take one check to find the number 16. It would take one check because the order of the numbers are ascending up, so it would give me the middle index number. .",

What is Iteration? . Iterative statements are also called loops, and they repeat themselves over and over until the condition for stopping is met. . In College Board&#39;s Pseudocode, the first is a REPEAT n TIMES loop, where the n represents some number. . The second type of loop is a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop, where the loop will continue to run until a condition is met. . Conceptually, a while loop is very similar to an if conditional, except that a while is continually executed until it&#39;s no longer true and an if is only executed once. . Practice . Consider the Following Code Segment. What is the Counter Variable and the Condition set as? . for (var i = 10; i &gt; 0; i--) { println(i); } . Answer!

How Many times will print(ln) be called? . for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) { for (var j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j++) { println(i * j); } } . Answer! [100 Times.The computer will execute the outer for loop 10 times (starting at i = 1 and ending after i = 10). Each time that it executes the outer loop, it will execute the inner for loop 10 times (starting at j = 1 and ending after j = 10). Each inner execution will call println() once.10 times 10 times 1 is 100, so the computer will call println() 100 times.] Practice . Consider the Following Code Segment. What is it initial value?

Explanation: My answer choice is wrong because I got confused with the defintion of what a POP command does. A POP command removes the last item in a list. My confusion is now cleared up after this question, and this will help me better understand what a POP command does and its function. . Question 8 . Explanation: My answer choice is wrong because the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop does not iterate over an iterable and for a set amount of time and does not intuitively take an iterable or manipulate it over a set period using pointers. . Reflection . Initially, this lesson was difficult to understand because it was a very fast-paced lesson, which made it hard to follow along. Overall, it was a lesson that was difficult to understand while the information was being presented, however, after applying thr information I learned to the exercises and quizes, it put together all the information and it helped make sense in my mind.

After this lesson, I learned how to create and write a flowchart in pseudocode while given a scenario. I also learned how to use a dictionary and use nested conditionals. I learned how to use if and if-else statements, and the difference between the two. An if statement is when you go through certain statements if the if expression is true. Whereas, if-else statement are when you go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false. I learned how to read and interpret different types of operators, AND, OR, and not through the binary truth practice. The binary truth practice was difficult initially, however, I understood it after my group explained it to me. I followed a tutorial to use nested conditionals in my Python dictionary, which was helpful since I was new to using and coding nested conditionals. .",

The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program test - input burger, expect output of burger price run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;Your total price is: $&quot; + str(menu[item])) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 Your total price is: $3.99 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... .

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",

I went to La Jolla beach with my friends and we walked around and found the La Jolla Observatory Deck, which is a hidden spot in San Diego. We watched the sunset from the deck and it was pretty. After, we went to Del Mar and got dinner in a food court. I had ramen with chicken and it tasted really good. The name of the restaurant is Marufuku ramen in Del Mar. After we ate dinner we went to One Paseo and got ice cream at Salt &amp; Straw. . Saturday: . I ran errands with my dad and drove him to each place he needed to go to because I have my permit, so I get in my driving practice while my dad gets his errands done. In the afternoon, I went to my best friend’s birthday party. She turned 17. Before the party, I went to my friend’s house and I got ready with her. Then, we both went to our friend’s house and met up with everyone. She got a party bus for everyone, so we took the party bus to Little Italy in San Diego Downtown. On the way there, we all sang and danced to music. After one hour we got down in Little Italy and ate dinner at an Italian restaurant. I had lobster ravioli followed by tiramisu cake, which were both very good. After we finished with dinner, we went on the party bus on the way home and danced and sang. I had a lot of fun and it was enjoyable. . Sunday: . I spent the day with my family. It started off with going to the farmer’s market with my parents. I had a chocolate almond croissant there and it has been my favorite croissant I have ever had in my life. Afterwards, I came back home and started doing my homework, which took almost until 9 PM. .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values | Data Types: there are different data types; numeric, sequence, mapping, set | Assignment Operators: allows a program to change the value represented to a variable | . Managing Complexity with Variables . Lists: allow consistent computations and changing the number of variables and helps multiple items that are related to each other to be treated a single value | 2D Lists: two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory | Dictionaries: used to store data values in key:value pairs | Class: an outline for creating a new object | Algorithms: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer | Sequence: steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. | Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available | Iteration: repeating steps, or instructions over and over again | Expressions: combination of operators and operands | Comparison Operators: Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right AND Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right | . Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables . Characters: one single unit of a text or character string, or individual characters | Strings: sequence of characters, consists of letters, numbers, and special characters | Length: ordered sequence of elements, elements are variables | Concatenation: operation of joining two strings together | Upper: converts all lowercase characters in a string into uppercase characters | Lower: converts all of the characters to lowercase | . Traversing Strings . Python If: go through certain statements if the if expression is true | Elif: go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false | . Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements . Python For: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated | While loops with Range, with List: used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met | . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it does not, how it does it | Python Def procedures: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Parameters: input values of a procedure | Return Values: values that a function returns when it completes | .",
