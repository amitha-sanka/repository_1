## Question 2 

2. Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm?

**My answer:** A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.

**Correct answer:** A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.

**Notes:** PNG uses a compression algorithm which keeps the picture's original data without information/data being lost. Ultimately, lossy and lossless images use different types of compression algorithms. Using lossy compression can save space but also introduce artifacts or distortions in the image. 

## Question 21

21. 

[q21]()

**My answer:** Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year AND Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer

**Correct answer:** Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year AND Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer

**Notes:** The correct sequence of steps should be organizing everything from least to greatest. The sequence I chose would not remove entries without an year, so the information and data in the spreadsheet would be inaccurate.
