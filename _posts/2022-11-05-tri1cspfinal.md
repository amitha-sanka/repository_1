# Test Corrections


1. Question: A company that develops educational software wants to assemble a collaborative team of developers from a variety of professional and cultural backgrounds. Which of the following is NOT considered a benefit of assembling such a team?

- **My answer:** Collaboration that includes diverse backgrounds and perspectives can help the team anticipate the needs of a variety of software users.
- **Correct answer:** Collaboration that includes diverse backgrounds and perspectives can eliminate the need for software testing.
- Notes: I misread this question, but working with people that come from different backgrounds helps the team and makes it more convenient for them that it can easily be tested. 





17. Question: Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet? 

- **My answer:** Open protocols ensure that all Internet users are provided connections with equal bandwidth.
- Correct answer: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.
- Notes: Open protocol isn't owned by any company and it's not limited to a company’s products. Ultimately, allows data to be standardized. 





20. Question: A video game character can face toward one of four directions: north, south, east, and west. Each direction is stored in memory as a sequence of four bits. A new version of the game is created in which the character can face toward one of eight directions, adding northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast to the original four possibilities. Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory? 

- My answer:  Four bits are not enough to store the eight directions. Eight bits are needed for the new version of the game. 
- Correct answer: Four bits are enough to store the eight directions.
- Notes: 4 bits are more than enough for the 8 directions. For example, 4 bits = 16 information.

## How I understood the mistakes? 

For the questions I got wrong, I went through my notes that I took on the Collegeboard videos and rewatched some of the videos to recall some of the concepts. In order to gain a greater insight about the binary numbers, I watched a few YouTube videos to understand the concept more. The videos helped, but I am still needing to rely on my notes.
