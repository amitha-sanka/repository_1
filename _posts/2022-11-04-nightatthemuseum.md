# Night of the Museum Reflection 

This was my second time at Night at the Museum. Night at the Museum was very fun and I enjoyed presenting my group and I's project. We presenetd about all of our favorite artists, Taylor Swift. It was fun presenting about Taylor Swift and getting more people to become a Swiftie. Presenting to others was fun, however, I think just the format of how everyone presented made it difficult. There were several APCSP groups crowded in the classroom and each group was scattered everywhere, so in terms of organization I think it could have been better and improved.
