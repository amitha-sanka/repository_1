# Reflection 

Overall, I had a really fun time learning about the CSUSM campus and experience. The presenters, Ashley and John were extremely resourceful and passionate about what they were presenting. I learned several things about how CSUSM works as a university and a few tips they learned while being in college. Since I will be going into college next year, I will take their tips with me and apply them to myself and experience at college.
