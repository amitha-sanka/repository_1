# 5.1 Hacks

## Blog Post Reflection 

**1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.** 

Three of my own beneficial effects of computing include: increasing your productivity, keeping you connected to the world, and connecting you to the internet. Although there are beneficial effects to computing there are harmful effects to computing. Computing can increase your productivity, however, it is also easy to be distracted by something else on your computer. One can be distracted by messages, games, and social media apps on their computer. Overall, leading to a decrease in one’s productivity and porosity levels. Computing can keep you connected to the world, however, being connected to the world comes up with issues like experiencing human traffickers and hackers online. Computing can keep you connected to the internet, but the internet has several disadvantages and harms such as addictions, spam, hacks, and viruses. 

**2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Something that is impacting my personal study and success in High School is the Advanced Placement courses I take and the activities and extracurriculars I do outside of school. I am often occupied with something which is a blessing and curse because being free with nothing to do puts me in my thoughts. However, having so much to do is bad for my mental health and contributes to my stress levels. I mainly just struggle with having so much on my plate and juggling all my responsibilties. In order to be less stressed I take time to myself each day and priotize going on a walk or going on a run to relax my body and mind. Setting time aside each day for myself has signifcantly helped and helps me get my mind off anything. It is overall really helpful to step outside into the nature and helps me rejuvenate.

## Blog Post Reflection – Digital Empowerment

**1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by not relying on technology. They can engage and empower themselves by going outside into nature and finding an acuity they enjoy. In order to be less attached to technology, one can also set limits and make use of the Apple screen time feature. This way they will have an idea of how long they spend their time looking at a screen. This would significantly help one because it would reduce the amount of blue light exposure to their eyes overall improving and better their life and mood. One can also use features such as night shift on their digital devices or even adjust the screen brightness on their phone. So, it does not affect their retina too much. 

**2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by encouraging them to decrease and adjust their screen brightness on their digital devices. Additionally, telling someone the changes they have noticed in their life after reducing brightness and screen time can help persuade them to also consider reducing blue lights from screens. Something that I could do at Del Norte High School is reminding students to decrease their screen time and screen brightness. I would tell them to spend time doing things they love that do not involve using or looking at a screen. Additionally, I think counselors or the Del Norte High School team can give presentations or a lesson plan to teachers to present to students. I think implementing things on paper can also potentially help students because it reduces the amount of bluelight they are exposed to by spending time on their phones for social media or doing homework. 

**3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Yes, I think red tape is blocking digital empowerment because the government is constantly trying to protect us from dangerous or violent things. The government protecting us is nice, however, I think it is also good for people to have access to things because the government hiding certain stuff it almost creates a feeling of danger for some. Since it seems like something is being hidden from you, and you will never figure out what it is. Yes, I think there are such barriers at Del Norte High School too because as a student you know information about a certain area. However, there is so much information students do not know because the school does not release or announce a lot of information. For example, several families donate money to the school, but paying to go on field trips still costs a lot. I also think red tape hides stuff elsewhere too.
