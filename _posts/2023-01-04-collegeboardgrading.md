# Student 1 

| Category | Requirements | Student Score | CB Grade | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | The video demonstrates the running of the program including: 
input: program functionality, output, describes the overall purpose of the program, describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video, describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video. | 1 | 0 |
| Data Abstraction | includes two program code segments: one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type). one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response.  describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program. | 1 | 1 |
| Managing Complexity | includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. | 0 | 0 |
| Procedural Abstraction | includes two program code segments: one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure.
one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | 1 | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation | includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, iteration, explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it.| 1 | 1 |
| Testing | describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c and each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute, describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure.
identifies the result of each call. | 1 | 1 |

# Reflection

After looking at student 1 and 2's projects and Collegeboard's grading, I learned... 
- Speak clearly 
- Keep the video concise 
- Use user input 
- In the written response, be clear when discussing code segments
- To make the video effective, be quick
