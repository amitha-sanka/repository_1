## Question 4

In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?

**My answer:**  

The program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors.

**Correct answer:**  

The program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value.

**Notes:** An overflow error occurs when a program receives a number, value or variable outside the scope of its ability to handle.

**My answer:**  

Program A and program B display identical values in the same order.

**Correct answer:**  

Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ.

**Notes:** I did not know that order does not matter before in terms of writing the i <-- i+1 before or after the display i.

**My answer:**  

Over 75% of the files stored are at least 100 KB in size.

**Correct answer:**  

Over 75% of the files stored are 10 MB in size or less.

**Notes:** The files all add up to 10 MB because 17% + 24% + %25 + 10%. 

## Question 24

**My answer:**  

The program displays the sum of the odd integers from 1 to 19.

**Correct answer:**  

The program displays the sum of the even integers from 2 to 20.

**Notes:** Due to the +2 and value being added to this, it is referring to the numbers being even. Therefore, even numbers from 2 to 20 are being displayed with the code.
