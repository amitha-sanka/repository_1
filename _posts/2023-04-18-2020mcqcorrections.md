## Question 4

In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?

**My answer:**  

The program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors.

**Correct answer:**  

The program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value.

**Notes:** An overflow error occurs when a program receives a number, value or variable outside the scope of its ability to handle.
