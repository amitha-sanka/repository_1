# Qualcomm Webinar Notes (10/17/2022):
 - Only girl to enter the field in engineering, no one in her family pursued science especially girls
- Faced gender roles in terms of being told be her family and friends that she should stick to be a girl that does household chores and was told that she should leave the breadwinner role to her husband
- After hearing everyone say this she wntd to prove them wrong and prove to herself that she was capable and began to discover her capabilities this way
- excited to come to San Diego because the Qualcomm headquarters were there
- although she was scared to make a huge move from India to San Diego, she was still so ecstatic because it was a new opportunity
- joined Qualcommâ€™s 4G project
- paused double e because she knew she could build up n the skills and electrical engineering double e would not close her doors
- having a growth mindset is key to becoming a successful software engineering
- hardware: design electronics, design and develop chips using languages like VLHS
- software: use and run it,
- learn coding in all engineerings except civil engineering
- hardware takes instruction from software
- software and hardware have to work closely together for final product
- companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Qualcomm are all companies that are looking for recruits
- Qualcomm = chips
- Apple = iPhone, computers
- Google = Virtual Reality, headset, Fitbit
- Amazon = Fire stick
- going above and beyond and challenging yourself is what colleges and universities are looking for
- take classes during high school where you are concurrently enroll in community college classes to show rigor
- learned the way to balance life and her work
- major challenge they faced was balancing life being a mother and working
- check your schools clubs to check out and its a good start to join your schools robotics team
- join a FIRST robotics team
- PlayStation used to hire students and they would get - paid to play video games before they released
- check potential job listings to be more involved in engineering
- As a student to be more involved a way to go is to be join the robotics team at school and interacting and making connections with teachers and students that may help you get options
