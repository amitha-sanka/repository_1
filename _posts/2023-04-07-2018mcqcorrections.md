## Question 1

**Correct answer:**

**Notes:** I read this incorrectly because I didn't really pay attention to the assignments in the start. I didn't read that first is assigned to temp, second is assigned to first, which led me to guessing on this question. But, now that I look at it, it makes sense since the code segments are assigned to values. 

## Question 21

**My answer:**

**Correct answer:**  

![21c](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010052426490982461/1093986651723800646/fd71beef-5553-417a-a82f-1ebf55612f91.jpg)

**Notes:** This block of code moves the robot an extra square forward and does not rotate the correct number of times. Therefore, with this block the robot will not move to the gray square with incorrect segments. 


## Question 41

**My answer:**

**Correct answer:**  

![41c](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010052426490982461/1093982989811204197/d1775d65-a2f2-44ba-a06d-b8820ac72fa7.jpg)

**Notes:** The addition of the +finalExam is neccesary because it needs to be assignted to the adjustedTotal. There needs to be another function that gets assigned to adjustedTotal.
