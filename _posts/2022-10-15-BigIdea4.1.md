title: College Board Big Idea 4.1 Notes
---

## 4.1 Daily Video 1: 

- 1975 still had big computers 
- arpanet is the first net we had 
- Advanced Research Projects Agency NETWORK
- the computers got smaller and smaller 
- packet: small amount of data sent over a network, consists of source and destination information 
- electrons use number systems 
- computer network: group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data 
- computer network is a type computing system 
- computer system: group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint response 
- packet switching: file/message is that is broken up into packets and sent in any order, packets are portrayed as the recipitent’s device 
- routing: helps find the path from sender to receiver 
- path: between 2 computing devices, sender and receiver, a sequence of connected computing device that starts at the sender and ends at the receiver 
- bandwidth is measured using bits per second 
- bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network 
- use packets to transmit data 

## Vocabulary Practice: 
- 1 = a
- 2 = e
- 3 = b
- 4 = c
- 5 = d 
- 6 = f 

## 4.1 Daily Video 2: 

- protocol: agreed upon set of rules that specifies the system behavior 
- OSI (open systems interconnect): layers to go through to communicate

- TCP (transmission control protocol): creates a common standard to send messages between different devices on the internet

- IETF (interest engineering task force): manages development of standards and technical discussions about the open internet 
- network access layer: setting up hardware that carries 0’s and 1’s between 2 devices, common example ethernet cable, used for local hops
- network access/internet layer data transmission: consists of data being transmitted and metadata that had information used for routing information 
- routers are unique computers with a MAC address 
- internet is scaleable and can meet the demands out there 
- Autonomous systems (AS): large intranets liked together under control and rules of major companies, large routers connect with large telecommunications connections 
- Local area network (LAN): physical connections (ethernet cable), limited by hardware and physics, 1 to 100s of systems 
- Intranet: LANs connected by Routers within an organization 
- Internet: autonomous systems (AS) linked together 
- Transport Layer: 
- TCP is stricter because it ensures that the package was delivered, error checking and error recovery - slower 
- UDP: laidback and slower, performs error checking, discards errors packets 
- Internet Layer 
- port: number given to application/service

Application Layer
- http: how to ask/receive data from web servers - uses TCP, Port 80 at transport layer 
- https: has security, users TCP Port 443 

## Review: 
- 1 = T
- 2 = F
- 3 = F
- 4 = T
- 5 = F
- 6 = F
- 7 = T

## Test Correction: 

Quiz 1: 
1. Protocols allow multiple telecommunication companies to communicate in an easy way and the protocols make it more convenient. 
2. I misread the answer choices and did not notice how the answer I chose said “protocol” instead of “site.” 

Quiz 2: 
1. I did not pay close attention to the image in the question, which is why I got the question wrong and if I looked at lines 3 and 7 I believe I would’ve got the question right. Interchanging lines 3 and 7 ensures that if reducing score by penalty results in a negative value, score is set to 0.
