    "After this lesson, I learned how to create and write a flowchart in pseudocode while given a scenario. I also learned how to use a dictionary and use nested conditionals. I learned how to use if and if-else statements, and the difference between the two. An if statement is when you go through certain statements if the if expression is true. Whereas, if-else statement are when you go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false. I learned how to read and interpret different types of operators, AND, OR, and not through the binary truth practice. The binary truth practice was difficult initially, however, I understood it after my group explained it to me. I followed a tutorial to use nested conditionals in my Python dictionary, which was helpful since I was new to using and coding nested conditionals. "
