    "I attempted doing this hack, however, I got stuck and did not understand so, I looked the answer to gain a better understanding. After, looking at the answer I noticed how the code in the answer is condensed in a simpler and shortened format and way, however still has the same function. In addition, the answer code does not set the peak, counter, and peak_index to 0 since using the counter function already assumes that it begins at the value 0 and that there is no reason in for typing in the 0. There are also array.slice and mid_index, which I observed were being used in substitution for the if else statement. The if else command is also used to reverse the array and to find the peak. Ultimately, the code is written in a shortened and simpler format in order to be efficient and easily understand for the user. "
