    "In order to find the difference of two binary numbers, the borrowing method needs to be used. After researching, I found that this was the best and easy way that made sense to me. First, you subtract the right binary number and the right binary number from the minued. In some cases, depending on the number you need to borrow from the left and add two to the minued. The next step is to just subtract the remaining numbers and borrow depending on the circumstance. To find the product of binary numbers, its like decimal multiplcation. So, you multiply one number by the other and you add the product results. To find the quotient, you need to divide both the binary numbers, using long division and dividing decimals. Then, this all leads to your quotient of the binary numbers. \n",
