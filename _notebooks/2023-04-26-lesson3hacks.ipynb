    "2.What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates?(1-2 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between boolean expressions and logic gates is that boolean operations are mathematical functions used on boolean values. Whereas, logic gates are the realization of Boolean operations. Logic gates process binary data in a computer by performing Boolean logic operations like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.\n",
