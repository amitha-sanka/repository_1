    "## OpenSSL Quiz \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of OpenSSL? \n",
    "\n",
    "D. All of the above \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is D because OpenSSL genrates public keys, encrypts data, and signs certificates. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the role of the private key in OpenSSL?\n",
    "\n",
    "C. It is used to encrypt data sent to the server\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is C because it secures communications through encryption and digital signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the SSL/TLS handshake?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. The process of signing a certificate request with a trusted CA\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is A because the SSL/TLS handshake happens to securely connect the server and web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are some command-line tools provided by OpenSSL?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. openssl genpkey, openssl signcert, openssl encrypt\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is A because these commands help make keys, sign certificates, and codes web data. \n",

    "1. What is Lego? \n",
    "\n",
    "B. An open-source ACME client for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because lego helps automate the process of obtaiing and renewing SSL/TLS certifcates. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What challenges does Lego support for domain validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. HTTP-01 and DNS-01 \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because it supports these for domain validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What features does Lego provide for managing SSL/TLS certificates? \n",
    "\n",
    "D. All of the above \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is D because lego integrates with popular web servers and load balancers, has dvanced configuration options, and upport for multiple domains in a single certificate and wildcard certificate. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does Lego ensure that SSL/TLS certificates are always up-to-date?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. By automatically renewing the certificates because they expire \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because Lego ensures that domains are always secured with up to date certificates. \n",

    "OpenSSL and LibreSSL have several types of security features. They both provide a range of security features for applications and systems. One security feature is certificates where OpenSSL and LibreSSL both use SSL/TLS certificates. LibreSSL reduces the risk of memory leaks and elimnates attack vectors. In terms of API compatibility, LibreSSL is designed to be API-compatible with OpenSSL. The difference here is that LibreSSL uses a different random number generaotr than OpenSSL. Since LibreSSL has made changes to the OpenSSL codebase they have improved security and removed potential vulnerabilities, so it is a tiny bit more secure than LibreSSL. Ultimately, the security between the both mainly depends on the situation, use, and security requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been recent vulnerabilites within OpenSSL and LibreSSL. OpenSSL vulnerabilities include CVE-2021-3449 which overflows in the X.509 certificate parsing code of OpenSSL. Another vulnerability is CVE-2020-1967, which is a padding oracle that can decrypt between a client and server. CVE-2020-1971 vulnerability is the X.509 certificate validation code of OpenSSL. LibreSSL vulnerabilites include CVE-2020-1972, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the ASN.1 parsing code of LibreSSL. CVE-2020-13777, a timing side-channel vulnerability in the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher implementation of LibreSSL. Lastly, another vulnerability is CVE-2019-1543, a denial of service vulnerability in the SSL/TLS certificate handling code of LibreSSL. \n",

    "## Hacks\n",
    "1. Virtual desktops and KASM play signifcant roles in enhancing the security of computer systems. They both help run multiple desktop environments simoltaneously on one machine. The desktops prevent malware and security threats from transmitting to other desktop environments making it easier and convenient to manage security updates. Virtual desktops such as these can be utilized in our AP CSP environment by being processed when we use different applications and programs on our computers in different environments. \n",

    "Question 1: How does AWS Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS works by building and running applications and services in the cloud. By using the services such as EC2 it helps compute the database. The tools and services provided by AWS help users manage cloud resources and help users create, configure, and monitor autonmous tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: How is AWS useful for projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS is useful for projects because AWS projects let you scale up or down based on demand and traffic in order to accomdate growth over time. AWS is also cost effective because users can pay as they go. Users can also deploy projects and applications fairly easily because AWS provides tools and services to deply in the cloud. There is also a lot of security surrounded around AWS because there are several security features that protect data and applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: How does Duck DNS Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck DNS works as a free service that allows users to assign a domain name to a IP address. Users first have to make a account and sign to chose a domain name. The domain name already has a given form and it installs a client on the device that has the IP address. Later, the configuration occurs and Duck DNS account information is used for your domain name and accout token. Duck DNS processes all updates by itself. Users can access their IP address easily and can access it from anywhere after. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: How is Duck DNS useful for projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck DNS is useful for projects because it has a easy setup process that helps set up and configure. Several other services and tools can be used along with DuckDNS, so it ends up being more useful for specific projects and situations. Users can assign a domain name to nay device with a IP address, so there is a lot of flexibility included too. Lastly, Duck DNS is a free service online, so it is a cost effective way of getting a domain for free without paying expensive prices. \n",

    "Duck DNS is useful for our projects and works by projects that involve remote access or control of a device, such as setting up a home security camera, remote desktop access, or hosting a website or game server from a home network. By using Duck DNS, the device or service can be accessed using a static hostname, which is more convenient than having to remember or constantly look up the device’s changing IP address. Also, Duck DNS is easy to set up and does not require any special hardware or software. It can be configured to update the IP address automatically, making it a reliable and low-maintenance solution for dynamic IP addresses. Steps are to create a free account, choose hostname, configure to update IP address with DuckDNS own domain name, and test hostname through browser. Duck DNS is a useful tool for any project that requires a static hostname for remote access or control of a device or service. Duck DNS is a unique tool because it is simple and is integrated with other automation services. \n",
