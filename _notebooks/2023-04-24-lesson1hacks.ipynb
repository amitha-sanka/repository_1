    "## OpenSSL Quiz \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of OpenSSL? \n",
    "\n",
    "D. All of the above \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is D because OpenSSL genrates public keys, encrypts data, and signs certificates. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the role of the private key in OpenSSL?\n",
    "\n",
    "C. It is used to encrypt data sent to the server\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is C because it secures communications through encryption and digital signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the SSL/TLS handshake?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. The process of signing a certificate request with a trusted CA\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is A because the SSL/TLS handshake happens to securely connect the server and web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are some command-line tools provided by OpenSSL?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. openssl genpkey, openssl signcert, openssl encrypt\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is A because these commands help make keys, sign certificates, and codes web data. \n",

    "## Lego Quiz \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Lego? \n",
    "\n",
    "B. An open-source ACME client for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because lego helps automate the process of obtaiing and renewing SSL/TLS certifcates. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What challenges does Lego support for domain validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. HTTP-01 and DNS-01 \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because it supports these for domain validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What features does Lego provide for managing SSL/TLS certificates? \n",
    "\n",
    "D. All of the above \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is D because lego integrates with popular web servers and load balancers, has dvanced configuration options, and upport for multiple domains in a single certificate and wildcard certificate. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does Lego ensure that SSL/TLS certificates are always up-to-date?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. By automatically renewing the certificates because they expire \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because Lego ensures that domains are always secured with up to date certificates. \n",

    "OpenSSL and LibreSSL have several types of security features. They both provide a range of security features for applications and systems. One security feature is certificates where OpenSSL and LibreSSL both use SSL/TLS certificates. LibreSSL reduces the risk of memory leaks and elimnates attack vectors. In terms of API compatibility, LibreSSL is designed to be API-compatible with OpenSSL. The difference here is that LibreSSL uses a different random number generaotr than OpenSSL. Since LibreSSL has made changes to the OpenSSL codebase they have improved security and removed potential vulnerabilities, so it is a tiny bit more secure than LibreSSL. Ultimately, the security between the both mainly depends on the situation, use, and security requirements. \n",

    "There have been recent vulnerabilites within OpenSSL and LibreSSL. OpenSSL vulnerabilities include CVE-2021-3449 which overflows in the X.509 certificate parsing code of OpenSSL. Another vulnerability is CVE-2020-1967, which is a padding oracle that can decrypt between a client and server. CVE-2020-1971 vulnerability is the X.509 certificate validation code of OpenSSL. LibreSSL vulnerabilites include CVE-2020-1972, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the ASN.1 parsing code of LibreSSL. CVE-2020-13777, a timing side-channel vulnerability in the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher implementation of LibreSSL. Lastly, another vulnerability is CVE-2019-1543, a denial of service vulnerability in the SSL/TLS certificate handling code of LibreSSL. \n",

    "1. Virtual desktops and KASM play signifcant roles in enhancing the security of computer systems. They both help run multiple desktop environments simoltaneously on one machine. The desktops prevent malware and security threats from transmitting to other desktop environments making it easier and convenient to manage security updates. Virtual desktops such as these can be utilized in our AP CSP environment by being processed when we use different applications and programs on our computers in different environments. \n",
