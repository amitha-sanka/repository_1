    "\n",
    "D. All of the above \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is D because OpenSSL genrates public keys, encrypts data, and signs certificates. \n",

    "\n",
    "B. An open-source ACME client for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because lego helps automate the process of obtaiing and renewing SSL/TLS certifcates. \n",

    "2. What challenges does Lego support for domain validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. HTTP-01 and DNS-01 \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because it supports these for domain validation. \n",

    "3. What features does Lego provide for managing SSL/TLS certificates? \n",
    "\n",
    "D. All of the above \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is D because lego integrates with popular web servers and load balancers, has dvanced configuration options, and upport for multiple domains in a single certificate and wildcard certificate. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does Lego ensure that SSL/TLS certificates are always up-to-date?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. By automatically renewing the certificates because they expire \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is B because Lego ensures that domains are always secured with up to date certificates. "
