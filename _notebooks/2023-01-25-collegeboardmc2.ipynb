The majority of the questions I got wrong were because I did not read the question fully or did not understand a vocabulary term used in the question. Therefore, I will be practicing and gain a deeper understanding of the vocabulary terms. I will try doing this by using Quizlet, Khan Academy practice, and watching videos on YouTube. Ultimately, I believe I am solid and fully understand the majority of the concepts we have learned thus far in APCSP. "
