    "From today's lesson on Sections 14 and 15, I learned about libraries and the different functions I can use to create randomization. I learned that libraries are useful in terms of simplfying a program and being more efficient when doing so. Using documentation is helpful when writing code because you can easily refer to it and understand it easily for yourself or even when helping others. There are multiple random.___ functions which help generate values in different . The random.___ functions are random.item, shuffle, and randint, which all have a different function and are used in different cases. In terms of how the lesson, I think I grasped the topics easily and understood the content thoroughly due to how the lesson was organized and taught. It was taught in a organized way and "
