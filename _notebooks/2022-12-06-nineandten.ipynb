    "8. Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search. \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because it makes it easier to find an item in a sorted list of items. It's more efficient because it works by continuously dividing half the proportion of the list , which could contain the item until it is narrowed down to one location. It is useful and efficient especially when there is a large set of data because it sorts it and finds the user’s final goal. Sequential search Is not as efficient as binary search because it finds a value in an unsorted array. However, if an array is sorted in the order of increasing value, then binary search is the most efficient and ideal way to go when approaching searching. \n",
