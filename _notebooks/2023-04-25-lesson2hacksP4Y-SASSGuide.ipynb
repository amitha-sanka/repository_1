    "### In your own words, explain what SASS does:\n",
    "- SASS which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets is scripting language used to customize and personalize features and code. With SASS users can customize variables such as colors, font sizes, and padding values and ultimately customizing throughout the stylesheet. This helps applications look more aesthetically pleasing and maintain a consistent look throughout the website. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some benefits to SASS?: \n",
    "- There are several benefits to SASS, but a few include customizing nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, and built-in functions. SASS allows users to write clean and easy code and at the same time SASS is stable and powerful. The way the code is organized makes SASS convenient too especially compared to CSS. SASS makes it easier to maintain and upadte stylesheets and reduces development time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe/Explain one of the more \"advanced\" SASS properties below in detail:\n",
    "- The advanced SASS properties refers to the user interface quality. This is because if there is more SASS, it makes it easier for the user to navigate through a website. The advanced SASS properties includes functions like duration, delay, and iteration. Advanced SASS properties are used by using dollar signs combined with variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the number guesser game work?\n",
    "- The number guesser game works by function in the code chosing a random number. Then, the user has to guess a number from 1-100 and they press the submit button, which then tells the user if their number is too low or too high. The button has three different outputs of too low, correct, and too high and the user basically inputs a number until they get it correct based on what the website prints. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing?\n",
    "- SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing because the background of the random number guesser game was changed. In order to change the text color and to customize and personalize the button, SASS was also used here. The background of the random number generator is initially red, however, when the user gets the number correct the background turns green. So, SASS was used in this part of the random number generator. In order to position the text and the font size on the website, SASS was used to center the text and the buttons. "
