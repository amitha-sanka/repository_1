    "The Section 16 lesson was semi difficult to understand, I understood a majority of it initially. However, after finishing the hacks I gained a better understanding of simulations and how they function. The way the lesson was presented made it a little confusing to me because it mainly consisted of a lot of defintions being presented, so actually understanding the material was difficult while the group was presenting."
