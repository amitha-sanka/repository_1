    "- **Parameters:**  input values of a procedure. \n",
    "- Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called\n",
    "- There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements\n",
    "- When you are picking a name for the procedure it must be descriptive\n",
    "- See if you need any parameters for this procedure (what data do you need to accomplish my goal? What king of information am I going to need?)\n",
    "- 2 of the parameters in the example below could be the quizGrade and currentPoints (need this data)\n",
    "- How to code Procedures-While Coding a procedure you must makes sure it has as name and a clear purpose weather to executre a response or complete an action\n",
    "- One common type of abstraction is procedrual abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. \n",
    "- **Modularity:** the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program"
